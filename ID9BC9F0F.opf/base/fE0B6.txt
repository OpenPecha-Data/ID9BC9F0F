And became a father to your heart-born son—

To assuage the sufferings of the lower realms,

The crowning ornament of all the adepts of Bhoṭa.2

In places such as the hermitage of Trowo valley

You are the precious lord of Dharma, the heruka,
pal dakmema dang gyé rol zhuk
Who dwells in delight with Nairātmyā.3

And who, with oceanic tantras of definitive secret Dharma,
bu kalzang lob tsok mindrol dzé
Matured and liberated hosts of fortunate disciple-children.

jé mi yi lü la sangye tuk
Precious lord who has a buddha’s mind in a human body,
gön sé ché gyalwé trinlé dzé
With your heirs, you carried out the victorious ones’ activity.
dü danta zhuk na gawa la
If only you were here right now, how happy I would be!
gön khyö zhal jalwé kalwé wen
But I am bereft, O protector, with no chance to see your face—
bu lé ngen dribpé nyepar zé
A child of evil karma mired in the fault of obscurations.

pa chö kyi ying na zhuk zhindu
O Father, as you dwell in the dharmadhātu,
zuk long trul gyi rolpa gyün mi ché
The play of nirmāṇakāya and sambhogakāya forms continues,
khor dak dang ma dak talé nam
Leading infinite assemblies, pure and impure,
dré changchub chenpö sa la gö
To the fruitional state of great awakening.

Precious lord, your activity is as pervasive as space itself.
bö münpé gyalkham karpor tong
You brought the light of purity to the benighted land of Tibet.

And with innumerable mantra adepts and vidyādharas
pal drubgyü tenpé dzamling khyab
Spread the teachings of the glorious practice lineage throughout the world.

O protector, no other life of liberation can compare to yours.

You who are inseparable from glorious Saraha,
pa lo tsa chenpö kadrin dren
Great father translator, I recall your kindness.
sa chusum tsemor rab chinpé
You who reached the peak of the thirteen stages,
pal yenlak dünden dorjé chang
Glorious Vajradhara with the seven aspects of union,
ku tamal gyi nampar rab tenpa
Who manifested perfectly in an ordinary form,
jé lho drak chenpor solwa deb
Great lord of Lhodrak, to you I pray.

ku nyima gyapé ziji dang
Your body has the majestic splendour of a hundred suns,
sung chö kyi drayang u ru ru
Your speech resounds with the melodious tones of Dharma,
tuk zab zhi dé tong ösal ché
And your mind is profound peace, bliss-emptiness, great luminosity—
pa sang sum gyi jinlab tsungda dral
O Father, the blessings of your three secrets are beyond compare.

dak mögü kyi solwa deb nü na
If I can supplicate you with devotion,
jé tuk kyi ngepar mi tong nyam
I trust that you, precious lord, will not fail me.
bu dak la jinlab kyi pa pok dé
Now is the time for patrimonial blessings
dü danta nyi du tsol ré ren
To be imparted to me, child that I am.

lo drepo tarpé lam la gyur
Turn this stubborn mind of mine toward the path of liberation;
nang dendzin drawa hrulpo shik
Tear apart the web of clinging to appearances as real;
chö zungdzin gyi tröpa ying su zhi
Let the constructs of dualistic perception cease within basic space;
sem rigpa kyemé ösal dé
Allow me to sustain, at all times without interruption
dü gyünché mepar taktu kyang
The clear light of mind’s own unborn awareness;
nga tsok druk gi nangwa rang sar drol
Cause all sensory perceptions to be freed, just as they are;
jé khyö dang gongpa nyampar shok
And make me your equal, O precious lord, in wisdom intent.

When Chökyi Lodrö, who has a well-developed purity of perception towards all teachings without
sectarian bias, felt an unbearable surge of devotion for the precious Lord of Lhodrak on
the evening of the 19th of the aśvinī (ninth) month of the Iron Dragon year, some words
of prayer came to mind, but he did not commit them to writing. He prayed again on the 20th
and wrote down these words. May they become a cause for the blessings of the great lotsāwa
to enter the heart. Maṅgalam. On the evening of the 19th referred to above, a visionary
encounter with the great lotsāwa, who was dressed in white and whose  hair and so on were
just as depicted in modern traditions of portraiture, inspired a devotion without bounds.

↑ The four transmissions (bka' babs bzhi) received by Tilopa, from which the Kagyü (bka' brgyud)
School takes its name are generally said to be: 1) Cāryapa's instructions on caṇḍālāi
or tummo (inner heat), 2) Nāgārjuna's instructions on illusory body and clear light or luminosity
(prabhāsvara), 3) Kambala's instructions on dreams, and 4) Sukhāsiddhī's instructions
on bardo and transference of consciousness ('pho ba).↑ Bhoṭa is the Sanskrit word for
Tibet.↑ The Tibetan name of Marpa’s wife Dakméma (bdag med ma) is a translation of the Sanskrit
Nairātmyā, the name of Hevajra's consort.
