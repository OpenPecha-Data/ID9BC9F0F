The Excellent Vase of Ambrosial Advice

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

I pay homage to the lord guru.

Child, without procrastinating,Meditate on death’s uncertain hour,Reflect on the tribulations
of saṃsāra,And act meticulously in accordance with causality.

Continually discipline your own mind.Embrace mindfulness, vigilance and conscientiousness.And
constantly train your mind in bodhicitta,Which is the very essence of the Dharma.

Develop the sincere, undeceitful wishTo be of benefit to all sentient beings.And, with stable
faith and devotion,Pray to your glorious root guruFrom the very core of your heart.Receive
empowerment and merge mind and wisdom.In that experience, you’ll find mind has never arisen—Its
essence is empty, its nature is clarity,And its resonance, the radiance of awareness,
unceasing.Once, through the kindness of the guru, you recognizeThis pristine wisdom,
the fourth part beyond the three,[1]In which the three kāyas are indivisible,Settle naturally
without contrivance.Unbound by dualistic conceptions,Allow whatever arises to be spontaneously
freed.

Exert yourself constantly in the approach and accomplishmentOf the Three Roots, and make prayers
of aspiration.

Acting in this way will prove significant.

Through imparting this brief counselWith a loving intention,May your mind be benefittedAnd the
twofold benefit of self and other be spontaneously accomplished.

This was spoken by Chökyi Lodrö.
