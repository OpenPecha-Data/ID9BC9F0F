	<h2>Sweet Nectar of the Supreme Vehicle</h2>
<h3>A Synopsis of the Stages of the MahÄyÄna Path</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Jamyang Khyentse ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Homage to the guru and protector MaÃ±jughoá¹£a!</em> </p>
<p>Merely to recall you within the sky of my mind<br/>
Serves to dispel the pitch-darkness of delusion.<br/>
Precious one, great treasury of knowledge, VajratÄ«ká¹£á¹a,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
I present the great bliss chakra of my crown at your feet. </p>
<p>Even though the profound and vast MahÄyÄna treatises<br/>
Have not entered the slender needle-eye of my mind,<br/>
Encouraged by a spiritual guide of the supreme vehicle,<br/>
I shall here reveal some sayings of past scholars and adepts. </p>
<p>Throughout beginningless time in this ocean of existence,<br/>
As we fail to recognise the natural state of our own buddha nature,<br/>
The primordially free sphere of reality, we wander through saá¹sÄric states,<br/>
Enclosed within the confines of our karmic and emotional obscurations. </p>
<p>Now, as a result of positive deeds gathered in the past,<br/>
We have found an excellent support in the higher realms, a basis for liberationâs certain good,<br/>
This precious human body with its adornments of freedoms and advantages,<br/>
Surpassing even the situation of the mighty gods Brahma, Åiva and Indra. </p>
<p>Having found such a basis, if we were simply to squander it<br/>
Until the fourth and final stage of birth, ageing, sickness and death,<br/>
There could be no greater loss, no graver tragedy than that.<br/>
So we must apply ourselves swiftly to Dharma practice. </p>
<p>If weâre constantly deceived by the eight worldly concerns<br/>
And by sensory delights, our lives are like butter lamps<br/>
In which the fuel is running out and cannot be replaced,<br/>
And thereâs no one who can save us or offer protection. </p>
<p>Develop a mind of determination to escape conditioning,<br/>
And recognise that no matter how many worldly riches<br/>
We might acquire, theyâre transient, the stuff of illusion,<br/>
Devoid of any true essence or significance. </p>
<p>Anyone who has wealth will have suffering.<br/>
The fault of attachment will naturally develop,<br/>
On top of which, pride and jealousy will arise.<br/>
Destroy, therefore, this great entanglement, source of a hundred ills,<br/>
And remain content, with few desires and limited needs. </p>
<p>From the summit of existence all the way down to AvÄ«ci,<br/>
Nowhere is there even the slightest speck of true happiness.<br/>
Itâs vital to consider how weâre constantly assailed<br/>
By the three sufferings and to feel disenchanted. </p>
<p>All that is born must naturally expire in the end,<br/>
Accumulated wealth will be exhausted in time.<br/>
Whatâs elevated will eventually be brought low,<br/>
And gatherings will, by their nature, disperse. </p>
<p>Reflect again and again on how everything, <em>everything</em>,<br/>
Is quick to perish and cease, unlasting and unstable,<br/>
And how beingsâ lives are more fragile than bubbles,<br/>
And thus limit the scope of your plans accordingly. </p>
<p>No matter where we are reborn among the six classes in saá¹sÄra,<br/>
It will bring suffering, as if it were a fiery pit or island of ogresses.<br/>
Knowing this, we must exert ourselves in the means of escape<br/>
From these six classes, on the path of liberationâs certain good. </p>
<p>All phenomena depend on causes and conditions.<br/>
With confidence in the validity of this infallible process<br/>
Whereby apparent things arise unceasingly through dependent origination,<br/>
We must adopt and avoid certain actions in line with their results. </p>
<p>The truth of the origin, karma and the mental afflictions,<br/>
Brings about the result, the truth of suffering.<br/>
Its cessation brings the realization of the exalted,<br/>
To actualize which we must strive to follow the path. </p>
<p>As a support for vows, take refuge in the Three Jewels,<br/>
And develop stable confidence, trust and faith.<br/>
As the root of the MahÄyÄna path, develop altruism,<br/>
Noble intention and the precious mind of bodhicitta. </p>
<p>Recognise all beings throughout the whole of space<br/>
As your own mother and father from the past.<br/>
Recall the great kindnesses that they all have shown,<br/>
Cultivate the mind training of exchanging oneself and others,<br/>
And practise repaying the kindnesses of oneâs parents throughout the six realms.<br/>
Uproot the stubborn vine of cherishing oneself.<br/>
Quash the attitude of seeking exclusively your own happiness,<br/>
And dedicate body, speech and mind to virtue in pursuit of othersâ wellbeing. </p>
<p>Free from attachment, recognise illusoriness,<br/>
And by uniting skilful means and wisdom,<br/>
Strive always to avoid unwholesome action,<br/>
Accumulate virtue, and secure beingsâ welfare.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> </p>
<p>Through the six perfections, the mainstay of bodhisattva conduct,<br/>
And the four means of attraction, train beings comprehensively.<br/>
With deep wisdom, transcend the limits of existence and quiescence,<br/>
And thoroughly tear through the web of the two forms of obscuration. </p>
<p>The profound wisdom that realizes the absence of self-identity<br/>
Derives initially from theories based on study and reflection.<br/>
Thereafter it is experienced in meditation involving effort,<br/>
And finally it becomes definitive, direct and natural realisation.<br/>
At which point, the eggshell of ignorance is broken apart<br/>
And the sunlight of wisdom realisation shines upon the dark. </p>
<p>Then, as far as the Vajra Vehicle is concerned,<br/>
Since it has many methods, is swift and without difficulty,<br/>
Those of superior intellect should focus primarily upon it.<br/>
The paths of the three outer tantras are a little slower<br/>
So study and practise whichever of the three inner tantrasâ<br/>
Father, mother or non-dualâappeals to you the most. </p>
<p>Receive empowerment from a fully qualified vajra master<br/>
Into a profound maá¹á¸ala, and from that moment on<br/>
Regard all that the teacher does with devotion,<br/>
Considering him or her to be inseparable from Vajradhara.<br/>
Visualize and practise this as the very essence of the path. </p>
<p>Should the samaya deteriorate youâll be forced to burn in infernal fires.<br/>
But, by keeping the commitments, even without practising meditation,<br/>
You will be liberated within the course of seven or sixteen lives. </p>
<p>Whether youâre practising the path of generation or completion,<br/>
You must ascertain the view that is the vital core of everything.<br/>
For this, you should examine using profound intelligence<br/>
The essence of your own clearly and vividly apparent mind.<br/>
This is not to been seen through analysis, for it lacks discernible essence.<br/>
Beyond conceptual notions lies utter peace, the dharmadhÄtu.<br/>
This is not some blank and empty void;<br/>
Itâs natural luminosity, ultimate and unconditioned,<br/>
Unchanging, beyond lack or surplus, addition or removal,<br/>
Realised nakedly and directly through our own awareness. </p>
<p>Focus on this method at regular periods based on the guruâs kindness.<br/>
Without it, paths will be as empty and as hollow as a plantain tree.<br/>
They will lack a core and fail to cut the root of conditioned existence.<br/>
Understand, then, that to learn this mystery of the mind<br/>
Is the unique course and intention of the buddhas of the three times. </p>
<p>With this, as the path of generation based on the vase empowerment,<br/>
Recognise the unity of appearance and emptiness, like the moonâs reflection,<br/>
And generate the visualization of the form of natural great bliss. </p>
<p>On the path of the secret empowerment, speech and wind-energy are purified.<br/>
Through exertion in remaining motionless and in binding and control,<br/>
Wayward wind-energies are brought within the central channel<br/>
And the precious jewel of kumbhaka made stable. </p>
<p>Through training the wind-energy in the yoga of subtle essences,<br/>
As a preliminary related to the knowledge-wisdom empowerment,<br/>
Master the emergence and reversal at the four chakras, and,<br/>
By bringing the essence into the chakras through the main practice of using a consort,<br/>
Loosen the knots in the channels, increase the strength of subtle winds and essences,<br/>
And develop the vigour that comes from accomplishing immortality,<br/>
Before ultimately attaining the level of Vajrasattva. </p>
<p>Thereafter, at the conclusion of this pure illustrative wisdom,<br/>
Cultivate the waves of the fourth empowerment.<br/>
Practise the three solitudes in particular, and settle without contrivance.<br/>
Actualizing the immaculate co-emergent wisdom of the genuine nature,<br/>
The vajra expanse, which is like the centre of the sky,<br/>
Will cause all the delusion of the three realms to fade away,<br/>
Bringing the full awakening that is the wisdom-essence of dharmakÄya,<br/>
In which the three kÄyas are present beyond any possibility of separation,<br/>
And the liberation of other beings occurs permanently, all-pervasively and spontaneously. </p>
<p>At all these stages, for the removal of obstacles and for enhancement<br/>
Consult the words of the genuinely learned and accomplished.<br/>
In particular, you should never be without devotion to the guru.<br/>
Merge mind and wisdom and receive empowerments again and again.<br/>
To restore samaya exert yourself in feast offering, fulfilment and recitation.<br/>
This will bring enhancement at every stage of generation and completion. </p>
<p>Always cultivate mindfulness, vigilance and conscientiousness,<br/>
And guard the vows youâve received as you would your very eyes. </p>
<p>By allowing renunciation, bodhicitta and genuine view<br/>
To support one another youâll make progress in the Dharma.<br/>
As Dharma progresses along the path it will pacify delusion,<br/>
And delusion will dawn as wisdom itself. </p>
<p>All the pure systems of the Buddhaâs teachings<br/>
Within this land of snowy peaks have but one intention.<br/>
So develop pure perception towards every tradition.<br/>
Cultivate genuine and sincere compassion for all beings.<br/>
Dedicate all forms of virtue and make noble aspirations,<br/>
And always strive to make the teachings and beings thrive. </p>
<p>In this degenerate age, when life is short and plagued by illness,<br/>
The compassion of Guru Padmasambhava<br/>
And the noble lady TÄrÄ is especially swift,<br/>
So pray to them and invoke their wisdom for your own and othersâ sake.<br/>
Make prayers of aspiration repeatedly for the wellbeing of Tibet. </p>
<p>By exerting yourself in the practice that combines<br/>
Generation and completion, the KhecarÄ« of NÄropa,<br/>
Whose direct vision was the fruit of blessings,<br/>
And whose line of blessings is undiminished,<br/>
The pinnacle of profound and vast instructions<br/>
Of the Sakya, sovereigns of the teachings as a whole,<br/>
Youâll spontaneously accomplish twofold benefit. </p>
<p>Thus, the sublime omnipresent lord Kangyurpa<br/>
Issued a request through the flute of his speech<br/>
For advice and an account of realization<br/>
Based on personal experience; alas, I lack such experience<br/>
And my life has been squandered on donated wealth.<br/>
Still, merely to avoid disobeying an instruction,<br/>
ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶, the savage who is devoid of Dharma,<br/>
Resorted to words of the sublime ones which he himself has not applied,<br/>
And wrote this on the third âjoyâ of the third month of the Water Dragon,<br/>
Together with the aspiration that any virtue be dedicated to all beings<br/>
And the wish that this might be of benefit to others. Virtue! </p>
<p><em>Sarva maá¹galam</em>. </p>
