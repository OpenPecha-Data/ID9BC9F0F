	<h2>Opening the Door of Dharma</h2>
<h3>A Brief Discourse on the Essence of All Vehicles</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Jamyang Khyentse ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Homage to the guru and the protector MaÃ±jughoá¹£a!</em> </p>
<p>You tear right through the web of self-oriented views,<br/>
And your sword of wisdom lights up the triple worldâ<br/>
Great store of all the victorious buddhas' insight,<br/>
Protector MaÃ±jughoá¹£a, to you I pay homage. </p>
<p>I could not describe all dharma systems<br/>
Of the infinite vehicles beyond imagining,<br/>
But I shall offer here a mere sketch,<br/>
A partial overview in a succinct style. </p>
<p>The omniscient teacher, Lion of the ÅÄkyas,<br/>
Turned the Wheel of Dharma in three stages:<br/>
The first was to counter the non-meritorious,<br/>
The intermediate to counter views of self,<br/>
And the last to counter all foundations of views. </p>
<p>The subject matter, which is the three trainings,<br/>
Is explained through the twelve branches of excellent speech.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
While some refer to the great vehicle of Secret Mantra<br/>
As the Inner Abhidharma, it is said to be<br/>
The scriptural category of the vidyÄdharas.<br/>
Counting it separately like this is maintained to be better. </p>
<p>Translations into Tibetan amount to just over a hundred volumes,<br/>
But the true extent of the Buddha's Word cannot be gauged.<br/>
The treatises that comment on the intent of Buddha's teachings<br/>
Include the Basic Vehicle's <em>Treasury of Detailed Classification</em>,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
And the Great Vehicle's commentaries by such scholars as<br/>
The Six Ornaments of the World<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> and Marvellous Masters<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a>â<br/>
An exceedingly large number of compositions in all.<br/>
There are also commentaries on the tantras of Secret Mantra,<br/>
SÄdhanas and pith instructions in number beyond imagining.<br/>
Through the kindness of the translators and paá¹á¸itas of the past,<br/>
Over two hundred volumes of these were translated into Tibetan.<br/>
All together they have served as the basis of the teachings. </p>
<p>In the Noble Land there was no distinction between New and Old.<br/>
In Tibet, as lotsÄwas translated in earlier and later phases,<br/>
The Old-New distinction arose, with the period before Rinchen Zangpo<br/>
Designated the time of the Ancient School of Early Translations,<br/>
And the translations of the period thereafter referred to as New.<br/>
Most of the Vinaya, SÅ«tra and Abhidharma collections,<br/>
As well as the three outer tantra classes of Secret Mantra,<br/>
Were translated during the period of the Early Transmission.<br/>
Highest Yoga tantras such as Saá¹vara, Hevajra, KÄlacakra and YamÄntaka<br/>
Were translated mostly in the later period, but the Ancient School of Early Translations<br/>
Also has a very large number of Highest Yoga tantras,<br/>
Such as the eighteen great tantras.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a><br/>
Although some scholars of the New Schools have stated<br/>
That these tantras are inauthentic,<br/>
The impartial understand them to be genuine.<br/>
Indeed, I think it is correct to do so.<br/>
Why? Because these texts accurately convey the profound and vast points<br/>
Of the Buddha's Word and the treatises,<br/>
And it is only right, therefore, to honour and respect them. </p>
<p>In the Ancient School of Secret Mantra there are nine successive yÄnas,<br/>
Which can be subdivided into two: the causal and resultant vehicles.<br/>
There are three causal vehicles: those of the ÅrÄvakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas.<br/>
And the resultant mantra vehicle includes three classes of outer tantra,<br/>
And three classes of inner tantras, which employ vast methods.<br/>
There are many further details for each of these,<br/>
Such as their respective views, meditation, conduct and results,<br/>
But since this is only a brief survey I cannot elaborate here. </p>
<p>The Ancient School of Early Translations has three categories of Word (<em>kama</em>), Treasures (<em>terma</em>) and Pure Visions.<br/>
The New School of Secret Mantra is also called the Jowo Kadam tradition.<br/>
Its members included AtiÅa, Gyalwa DromtÃ¶npa,<br/>
The Three Brothers,<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> and countless other holders of the teachings.<br/>
The Old Kadam became intermingled with the Sakya and KagyÃ¼.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a><br/>
Taking this as a basis, Jamyang Tsongkhapa<br/>
Expanded upon Vinaya, SÅ«tra, Madhyamaka, PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, Secret Mantra and so on,<br/>
And his tradition spread everywhere throughout the whole world.<br/>
He made profound statements concerning sÅ«tra and mantra<br/>
With the aid of his special deity and through his own discerning insight,<br/>
And special qualities are clearly evident in his excellent explanations. </p>
<p>The Sakyapa, which was founded by the five venerable patriarchs,<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a><br/>
Upholds the sÅ«tra and mantra tradition of many learned and accomplished ones<br/>
Of the Noble Land, such as the great lord of yogins VirÅ«pa,<br/>
NÄropa and VajrÄsana,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> as well as the Yangdak and KÄ«la practices<br/>
Of the Ancient School of Early Translations, which belong to the so-called KhÃ¶n Tradition.<br/>
Sakya Paá¹á¸ita, who was the crown jewel of all the scholars of this world,<br/>
Defeated a heretic, Harinanda, in debateâ<br/>
A feat no one else is known to have accomplished in Tibet.<br/>
There are three branches that uphold this lineage: Sakya, Ngor and Tsar.<br/>
ButÃ¶n's tradition (<em>Buluk</em>), the Jonang and the Bodong also stem<br/>
From the foundation of the Sakya school,<br/>
Albeit with some slight divergence in their views on sÅ«tra and mantra. </p>
<p>The KagyÃ¼ School derives from NÄropa and MaitrÄ«pa.<br/>
Marpa, Mila and Dakpo are the three lords of all KagyÃ¼pas.<br/>
It is from them that the four major and eight minor branches<br/>
And others derive, although most stem from Dakpo's student Pakmodrupa.<br/>
And among them, four still remain strong and undiminished to this dayâ<br/>
The Karma, Drukpa, Drikung and Taklungâ<br/>
While the others have grown extremely weak indeed. </p>
<p>The scholar-adept known as Khyungpo Naljor<br/>
Followed a hundred and fifty learned and accomplished teachers,<br/>
Including the two wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s of India,<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a><br/>
The masters RÄhula and MaitrÄ«pa, and others.<br/>
When transmitted in Tibet, his teachings became the Shangpa KagyÃ¼.<br/>
There is no one today who follows this tradition exclusively,<br/>
But the empowerments and reading transmissions continue in both Sakya and KagyÃ¼. </p>
<p>In addition, there is the Pacifying tradition<br/>
Of the Indian known as Dampa Sangye,<br/>
And Severance (ChÃ¶d), the Dharma of Machik LabdrÃ¶n. </p>
<p>There are thus a great many systems of Dharma teaching in Tibet,<br/>
But aside from their nominal variations,<br/>
There is really no significant difference between themâ<br/>
All share the crucial point of seeking ultimate awakening. </p>
<p>It is said that the Sakya and Gelug have a special command of teaching,<br/>
While the KagyÃ¼ and Nyingma have a special command of practice.<br/>
But, in fact, the scholars of former times put it like this:<br/>
The Nyingma opened the way to the teachings in the Land of Snows.<br/>
The Kadam became the source of millions of holders of the teachings.<br/>
The Sakyapas are the ones to spread the teachings in their entirety.<br/>
The KagyÃ¼ are unrivalled in the direct path<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> of practice.<br/>
Tsongkhapa was sun-like in his brilliant conveyance of fine explanations.<br/>
Jonang and Zhalu were sovereigns of the profound and vast tantra collection.<br/>
This account matches how things are in reality. </p>
<p>The treasures of the Nyingma school are teachings,<br/>
Common and uncommon, which Padmasambhava,<br/>
The great master of Oá¸á¸iyÄna, gave upon arrival in Tibet<br/>
To his disciples, the sovereign lord and subjects,<br/>
And which were then concealed as earth and mind treasures<br/>
To support the teachings and beings during the degenerate age.<br/>
When the time is right, they are revealed by sublime incarnations<br/>
And serve as bounty for the welfare of the teachings and beings. </p>
<p>There are many examples of 'pure visions' and 'whispered transmissions'<br/>
In both the Ancient and New traditions of Secret Mantra.<br/>
Some scholars have argued against the validity of the treasures.<br/>
However, since an examination of their purpose and underlying intention<br/>
Establishes the threefold validity of the terma teachings,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a><br/>
One must be careful to avoid denigrating them<br/>
And thereby incurring the grievous fault of hostility toward the Dharma. </p>
<p>The <em>One Hundred Thousand Lines</em> and so on were NÄgÄrjuna's treasures,<br/>
And adepts extracted tantric texts of secret mantra<br/>
From the stÅ«pa of Dhumathala in Oá¸á¸iyÄna.<br/>
Even in the Noble Land, then, treasure revelation existed.<br/>
There are many other such proofs, but I shall not elaborate further. </p>
<h3>The Path</h3>
<p>For all the systems of teachings described above,<br/>
The essence of the path is to generate renunciation.<br/>
For this, the basis is to maintain ethical discipline<br/>
According to any of the seven sets of pratimoká¹£a vows<br/>
And to contemplate the rarity of the freedoms and advantages. </p>
<h4>The Freedoms and Advantages</h4>
<p>Reflect carefully on how difficult it will be to obtain<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a><br/>
Such an excellent support and opportunity again in the future.<br/>
It is momentous to find something so scarce, like a wish-granting jewel. </p>
<h4>Death and Impermanence</h4>
<p>Yet this situation will not last long, as death comes quickly.<br/>
There's no telling when the old, young or middle-aged will die,<br/>
For many circumstances lead to death, while few sustain life.<br/>
Reflect repeatedly on the passage of time, changing of the seasons,<br/>
And inconstancy of rivalries and friendships, and recollect impermanence. </p>
<h4>Actions and Their Effects</h4>
<p>After death, we do not simply vanish into the ether.<br/>
Nor are human beings necessarily reborn as humans and horses as horses.<br/>
Wandering beings are propelled by their past actions.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a><br/>
The variety that exists among beingsâin status and condition,<br/>
Relative affluence or poverty and range of influence,<br/>
As well as variations in physical beauty and appearanceâ<br/>
All originates in the variety of our past karma,<br/>
Which may be virtuous, unvirtuous or mixed.<br/>
Virtuous and unvirtuous deeds are of ten types.<br/>
Based on the four types of effectâripening, cause-resembling, conditioning and proliferatingâ<br/>
Virtuous and unvirtuous acts give rise to particular results.<br/>
We do not encounter the fruits of deeds we have not committed;<br/>
The acts we have committed will never go to waste;<br/>
And the agent of an action is sure to face its consequences. </p>
<p>For a more detailed presentation of actions and their effects,<br/>
Including actions that bring about effects within the same life,<br/>
And acts that ripen in the next or subsequent lives,<br/>
Please consult the sÅ«tras, treatises or guidance manuals. </p>
<p>To adopt and avoid certain actions and their effects<br/>
Is the essence of the Dharma and a profound key point<br/>
Which encapsulates the four truths and dependent origination. </p>
<h4>The Trials of Saá¹sÄra</h4>
<p>Through karmic acts we wander through the six classes of beings,<br/>
Which consist of the three lower and three upper realms.<br/>
To put it simply, there is nothing, not even so much as an atom,<br/>
Throughout the desire, form and formless realms that is without fault.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a><br/>
Beings everywhere are tormented by the suffering of suffering,<br/>
Suffering of change and all-pervasive suffering of conditioning,<br/>
And each of the six classes has its own particular tribulations.<br/>
Non-virtue produces suffering as its effect;<br/>
Tainted virtue leads to rebirth in the higher realms;<br/>
And undeviating acts of mundane meditative absorption<br/>
Cast one into corresponding dhyÄna and formless realms.<br/>
But, as the source of saá¹sÄric existence has not yet been discarded,<br/>
Craving and attachment propel one into existence, and one falls back into saá¹sÄra.<br/>
To stay in these states of cyclic existence, therefore,<br/>
Is akin to remaining in a pit of flames or a nest of vipers.<br/>
Do not hanker after the pleasures of saá¹sÄra,<br/>
But develop the determination to escape conditioned being. </p>
<h4>Following a Teacher</h4>
<p>The basis for setting out on the path to liberation<br/>
Is to follow and rely upon a spiritual teacherâ<br/>
Subdued through study, ethical, steeped in bodhicitta,<br/>
With a pure and genuine view, immensely caring,<br/>
Capable of cutting through projections, empowered, and upholding the samayas.<br/>
Follow such a guru and carry out his or her every command.<br/>
Developing faith and devotion brings positive qualities,<br/>
So it is crucial that you follow an excellent guru.<br/>
The teacher's instructions are like the nectar of immortality:<br/>
Do not allow whatever you receive to go to waste,<br/>
But put it all into practice, reflect on it and meditate.<br/>
Hearing alone is not sufficient to bring benefit,<br/>
Just as thirst cannot be quenched without drinking.<br/>
So remain in solitary retreat upon a mountainside. </p>
<h4>Taking Refuge</h4>
<p>The foundation of the path is taking refuge.<br/>
This is the basis of, and support for, all vows;<br/>
It is what separates Buddhists from non-Buddhist outsiders,<br/>
And affords protection to all gods and human beings.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a><br/>
It is what brings all that is positive in this life and beyond.<br/>
Entrust yourself entirely to the Buddha as teacher,<br/>
Sacred Dharma as protection, and Saá¹gha as guides.<br/>
Do not simply mouth the words, but feel genuine trust,<br/>
And guard the precepts of refuge effectively. </p>
<h4>Generating Bodhicitta</h4>
<p>The main practice of the MahÄyÄna path is bodhicittaâ<br/>
Like butter that emerges when sacred Dharma milk is churned.<br/>
Without it, any practice of sÅ«tra or mantra which we may do<br/>
Will be devoid of essence, like the stalk of a plantain.<br/>
In addition, beings who exist throughout the whole of space<br/>
Have, over the course of our countless lives without beginning,<br/>
Been our very own parents innumerable times<br/>
And brought us benefit that is truly unimaginable.<br/>
Cultivate love, therefore, and great compassion<br/>
For all beingsâfriends, enemies and those in-between.<br/>
Fully dedicate your body, speech and mind to virtue,<br/>
Cultivate the excellent intention of benefitting others,<br/>
And continually recite extraordinarily noble aspirations. </p>
<h4>Accumulation of Merit and Purification</h4>
<p>It is crucial that, as a means of developing the authentic view,<br/>
You apply yourself to accumulating merit and purifying obscurations.<br/>
Perform the seven branches, offer prostrations, circumambulate, chant sÅ«tras,<br/>
Recite <em>dhÄraá¹Ä«</em> mantras and the <em>Bodhisattva's Confession of Downfalls</em>.<br/>
If you exert yourself with all four powers complete,<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a><br/>
You will cleanse and purify misdeeds, obscurations, faults and downfalls.<br/>
Make maá¹á¸ala offerings, the essence of gathering the accumulations.<br/>
For all such accumulations with conceptual reference,<br/>
To recognize how the three spheres are devoid of reality,<br/>
And integrate emptiness by means of insight<br/>
Brings about the accumulation of wisdom.<br/>
The accumulation of merit brings attainment of the rÅ«pakÄya,<br/>
And accumulation of wisdom brings attainment of dharmakÄya. </p>
<h4>Åamatha Meditation</h4>
<p>In order to strive for accumulation and purification like this<br/>
And to bring about the genuine view within the mind,<br/>
First seek calm abiding (<em>Åamatha</em>) through the nine stages,<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a><br/>
Overcoming the five faults<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> and applying the eight remedies.<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a><br/>
And when there is single-pointed focus with and without support,<br/>
Absorptionâblissful, clear, and non-conceptualâwill arise.<br/>
This itself serves merely to suppress mental afflictions. </p>
<h4>VipaÅyanÄ Meditation</h4>
<p>Then, because ascertaining the view with insight (<em>vipaÅyanÄ</em>)<br/>
Eradicates the ignorance of clinging to a self,<br/>
Which is at the root of beginningless existence,<br/>
You should meditate upon emptiness with certainty.<br/>
In order to overcome innate clinging to a self,<br/>
Which is the thought of &quot;I am&quot; that arises<br/>
Based on the assembly of the five aggregates,<br/>
It is crucial to apply precise and thorough analysis.<br/>
Investigate using the logical reasoning of the Middle Way<br/>
Whether self and aggregates are identical or distinct, and so on.<br/>
When you thus determine the absence of an individual self,<br/>
Consider the identity of perceiving and perceived phenomena,<br/>
By mentally dissecting the aggregates further into their component parts.<br/>
And, gaining conviction in the meaning of identitylessness,<br/>
Determine how all the phenomena of existence and quiescence<br/>
Are by nature unborn.<br/>
Understand the profound logic of dependent originationâ<br/>
How everything originates in perfect equality,<br/>
And how, out a state of unborn emptiness,<br/>
Visible and audible phenomena arise naturally, without obstruction.<br/>
When you gain understanding and experience<br/>
Of how emptiness is not separate from dependent origination,<br/>
Then, untainted by any grasping, settle for as long as you can<br/>
In the space of the Middle Way, free from conceptual elaboration. </p>
<p>In short, what we call the genuine view<br/>
Is the inseparable unity of wise insight<br/>
And single-pointed, immovable calm,<br/>
In which there is discerning intelligence<br/>
That alternates between analysis and rest.<br/>
This is the point of meditation on PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ,<br/>
The mother of all the buddhas.<br/>
Through the view beyond all concepts such as the eight extremes,<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a><br/>
The meditation of settling in accordance with this undistractedly,<br/>
And the action of the excellent noble path of the bohisattvas,<br/>
We achieve the results of the five paths and ten stages,<br/>
Gain the great awakening that is situated in neither existence nor quiescence,<br/>
And spontaneously accomplish our own and others' welfare. </p>
<h4>Nonsectarianism</h4>
<p>Alas! Nowadays, during this final stage of the five degenerations,<br/>
Many holders of the teachings have passed into the absolute sphere,<br/>
And the world is filled with people like me who spout nonsense.<br/>
The <em>asuras</em> are raucous in their laughter,<br/>
And beneficent deities have scattered and fled.<br/>
Now that the Buddha's teachings resemble nothing more than a painted lamp,<br/>
May those with great compassion pay heed.<br/>
All those who cherish the teachings of the Buddha<br/>
Should exert themselves in teaching and practising the transmitted and realized Dharma, and in renunciation, study and activity.<br/>
Never should they neglect the ten dharmic activities,<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a><br/>
And they must endeavour to pray, make offerings and accumulate merit.<br/>
Saá¹ghas must be harmonious and avoid sectarian bickering.<br/>
Do not be partial or divisive, and do not promote conflict in the teachings.<br/>
Avoid all denigration of the Dharma.<br/>
Recognise that all the various facets of the teachings, as extensive as the ocean,<br/>
Are there to discipline one's own mind, and practise them accordingly.<br/>
With body, speech and mind calm, disciplined and relaxed,<br/>
Always maintain mindfulness, vigilance and conscientiousness. </p>
<p>In accordance with the prophetic dream of King Ká¹kin,<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a><br/>
Eighteen schools arose among the ÅrÄvakas in the Noble Land,<br/>
Bringing disagreement to the teachings,<br/>
As a result of which they gradually declined.<br/>
In Tibet, to the north, the demon of sectarianism<br/>
Entered the Sakya, Gelug, KagyÃ¼ and Nyingma,<br/>
And disputes marred and corrupted the teachings,<br/>
Ruining present and future lives and leading self and others to wrongdoing.<br/>
Since this is not even slightly connected to the real point,<br/>
It should be roundly rejected as one guards the Buddha's teachings.<br/>
As a result of the Buddha's attainment of the level of fearlessness,<br/>
No one can destroy the teachings from the outside.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a><br/>
But, as the sÅ«tras say, they may still be ruined from within,<br/>
Like the carcass of a lion devoured by worms in its belly.<br/>
So keep this in mind, and adopt and avoid as you should. </p>
<p>If householders make offerings to the Three Jewels<br/>
And, with a wish to benefit, exert themselves in virtue,<br/>
This will bring about merit in this and all future lives. </p>
<p>I am now close to death and burdened by old age.<br/>
Although I have noble aspirations for the Buddha's teachings,<br/>
I certainly lack any capacity to bring real benefit.<br/>
Still, I shall persevere in praying for the Dharma to flourish. </p>
<p>The supreme source of benefit and happiness in the Land of Snows<br/>
Is Tenzin Gyatsoâmay his life long remain secure.<br/>
May the Paá¹chen Lama, the protector AmitÄbha,<br/>
As well as the Karmapa, JamgÃ¶n Sakyapa,<br/>
And other great holders of the teachings all live long.<br/>
May all their enlightened activity flourish and spread.<br/>
May the rulers, ministers and subjects of the Noble Land<br/>
Enjoy the happiness, splendour and prosperity of a golden age,<br/>
And may the Buddha's teachings once again spread widely.<br/>
May the great Dharma drum of the three scriptural collections resound,<br/>
And may all be auspicious for it to reach even unto the pinnacle of existence. </p>
<p>Thus, this Opening of the Door of the Dharma<br/>
Was written extemporaneously with a noble intention<br/>
At the request of the Political Office of Sikkim,<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a><br/>
By the ignoramus ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶,<br/>
Who holds the name of an incarnation of Jamyang Khyentse<br/>
And hails from the land of greater Tibet. </p>
<p>May the virtue of this be of aid to the teachings and beings. </p>
