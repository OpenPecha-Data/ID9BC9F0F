	<h2>The Play of Illusion</h2>
<h3>An Autobiography</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Jamyang Khyentse ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶</em></strong></p>
<p>Incomparable gurus, protectors of beings,<br/>
most gracious ones, I bow down at your lotus feet,<br/>
as devotion fills my body, speech and mind.<br/>
Now I shall relate the false tale of my life. </p>
<p>The land where I, the wicked one, was born<br/>
is the area known as the four land knots.<br/>
There, in a region called RekhÃ©,<br/>
on the banks of a golden river,<br/>
is the place called Ajam. </p>
<p>My father was compassionate,<br/>
unparalleled in kindness, a vidyÄdhara<br/>
known as Gyurme Tsewang Gyatso. </p>
<p>His ancestors included Gyalse Pema Namgyal,<br/>
a descendent in the family line of DÃ¼dul.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
Blessed by his secret body, speech and mind<br/>
was the great treasure-revealing vidyÄdhara,<br/>
NÃ¼den Namkhai Naljor,<br/>
whose son became my father. </p>
<p>My mother, called Tsultrim Tso,<br/>
was born into the family of a siddha<br/>
known as the renunciant of Amdoâs Ser Valley,<br/>
in the lineage of Achak Dru. </p>
<p>I was born as their son in the female Water Snake yearâ<br/>
during the autumn months, I heard it said.<br/>
My parents had little concern for such things,<br/>
so they left no written record<br/>
of the planets and stars, or dreams and signs. </p>
<p>I was raised and trained in a gradual manner.<br/>
When I reached my sixth year or thereabouts,<br/>
my maternal uncle, Lama Gelek,<br/>
began teaching me to read.<br/>
I thus learnt the thirty basic consonants and affixed signs,<br/>
as well as the maá¹á¸ala and seven branches from <em>Embodiment of Realization</em>.<br/>
On one occasion, I received<br/>
a longevity empowerment from Drakmar Yizhin Wangyal,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
and thereby forged a dharmic connection. </p>
<p>In my seventh year, the great Situ Paá¹á¸ita<br/>
sent a welcoming party<br/>
to invite me to Katok Monastery.<br/>
We arrived at Katok, the glorious and unsurpassable,<br/>
on a winterâs day just as snow was fallingâ<br/>
a positive sign of auspicious connection.<br/>
I stayed there in the residence of Longsal,<br/>
Dzong-ngo Tashi Khangsar. </p>
<p>On an auspicious day, the lord of refuge<br/>
performed the hair-cutting ceremony<br/>
before the statue of Buddha known as Lhachen PalbarââThe Great Deity Blazing with Splendourâ,<br/>
and gave me the name Jamyang LodrÃ¶ Gyatso. </p>
<p>Not longer afterwards, I began to study<br/>
with my gracious tutor Tupten Rigdzin Gyatso<br/>
at BartrÃ¶ ChÃ¶ling. </p>
<p>When I went to Horpo, I experienced boundless misery and hardship<br/>
on account of my youth.<br/>
I met the king and queen of Lingkar<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a><br/>
and explained the <em>Gangloma</em> praise<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> from memory. </p>
<p>As they remembered their guru,<br/>
the royal couple wept in devotion.<br/>
Ever since we have been connected<br/>
as benefactor and beneficiary,<br/>
with pure, unsullied samaya and great faith and affection. </p>
<p>Around this time my gracious tutor taught me to write<br/>
and instructed me in the preliminary practices (<em>ngÃ¶ndro</em>).<br/>
He explained <em>The Lamp of Speech</em>, <em>Thirty Verses</em> and <em>Application of Gender</em> twice,<br/>
as well as the <em>Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life</em> and <em>Treasury of Precious Qualities</em>,<br/>
the <em>SÄrasvatavyÄkaraá¹a</em> commentary on Sanskrit grammar and instructions on the generation phase (<em>bskyed rim</em>).<br/>
He taught them all in a simple way that was easy to comprehend. </p>
<p>He also encouraged me to explain <em>The Lamp of Speech</em> to others,<br/>
bestowed the reading transmission for Getse Paá¹chenâs writings,<br/>
and taught me various aspects of ritual in precise detail. </p>
<p>When I think back now on how he guided me in everything,<br/>
beginning with how to eat and dress<br/>
And all the various points of conductâwhat to do and what not to doâ<br/>
I'm moved to the point of tears.<br/>
<em>Care for me with compassion until I attain awakening!</em><br/>
Whatever qualities I now possess<br/>
are due solely to this great beingâs compassionate care.</p>
<p>At this time, I also received from the omniscient lord of refuge,<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a><br/>
extensive empowerments and transmissions<br/>
for the <em>Eight Deities</em> (<em>KagyÃ©</em>), <em>Gathering of Intentions SÅ«tra</em>, <em>Nyingma Kama</em>,<br/>
<em>Four-Part Heart-Essence</em>, <em>Peaceful and Wrathful Ones</em> and more,<br/>
but since I was unable to keep a record,<br/>
the details are not entirely clear. </p>
<p>Together with Situ Paá¹chen,<br/>
I received from Sherab, the previous Khyentseâs ritual master,<br/>
transmissions for the collected works of the Sakya patriarchs,<br/>
as well as the writings of Tsele, and more besides. </p>
<p>The all-seeing one acted as preceptor,<br/>
and together with the master of ceremony (<em>karmÄcÄrya</em>) Rigdzin Gyatso,<br/>
before a gathering of the saá¹gha,<br/>
he graciously bestowed on me the novice vows<br/>
and the name Tsuklak Lungrik Nyima MawÃ© SengÃ©.</p>
<p>Ever since, I have avoided the four root downfalls and other transgressions,<br/>
and I will continue to avoid them until this physical support eventually transforms. </p>
<p>I received all the empowerments for the revelations of Longsal Nyingpo and DÃ¼dul Dorje<br/>
directly from the master,<br/>
while Zhingkyong JewÃ¶n gave the corresponding reading transmissions.<br/>
At around the same time, I also received from this same master [i.e., Zhingkyong JewÃ¶n],<br/>
the transmission for the two volumes of Khyentseâs miscellaneous writings,<br/>
a text authorization for the protector Gaá¹apati,<br/>
the transmission of <em>The Ocean of Dharma that Combines all Teachings</em> and <em>Maá¹i Kabum</em>,<br/>
and the empowerment of <em>Cultivating the Pure Realm of Manifest Joy</em>.<br/>
Through these and other transmissions, we made multiple dharmic connections.<br/>
This was a master who paid special attention to those of lower status<br/>
and cared for everyone with a parental kindness. </p>
<p>I participated in several major offering rituals<br/>
at Katok during this period, both in summer and winter.</p>
<p>In my tenth year, I participated in the rainy season retreat<br/>
and was examined before the assembly<br/>
on various aspects of what had been taught.</p>
<p>In my eleventh year, I studied drawing<br/>
and the <em>SÄrasvatavyÄkaraá¹a</em> commentary with my tutor.<br/>
Around this time, I went collecting grains in the area around the Nyakchu river,<br/>
and in early summer I went to Tromkhok and elsewhere to collect dairy products. </p>
<p>Then, in my twelfth year, for three months,<br/>
I studied the five collections of astronomical calculations traced in sand.<br/>
I repeated what the teacher said and learned to calculate using my fingers,<br/>
but didnât understand [the underlying principles] in the slightest. </p>
<p>In the assembly hall at Katok I attended the Pure Land practice<br/>
and, to everyoneâs apparent astonishment,<br/>
explained the SukhÄvatÄ« aspiration. </p>
<p>When travelling to Tromkhok, at the Druk encampment,<br/>
I beheld the golden countenance of Natsok Rangdrol,<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a><br/>
the great vidyÄdhara master of incomparable kindness.<br/>
He expressed praise based on his pure vision,<br/>
bestowed a longevity empowerment and gave me a generous offering.<br/>
I met him many times during this period<br/>
and received ripening empowerments and liberating instructions for Gongpa Zangtal and Longchen Nyingtik,<br/>
as well as the Lama Yangtik and the masterâs own revelations.<br/>
He also gave me Dzogchen instructions related to TrekchÃ¶ and TÃ¶gal,<br/>
pointing out instructions and brought about enhancement.<br/>
He was immensely kind in both dharmic and worldly terms. </p>
<p>In my thirteenth year, my gracious tutor passed to a pure realm,<br/>
and left me stranded like a child alone in the desert<br/>
or a blind person lost and without a guide. </p>
<p>For three years my noble tutor suffered continuously with phlegmatic sickness.<br/>
Throughout this time, I put aside my own concerns and served as his attendant.<br/>
Tirelessly, I made tea, fetched water, nursed him and so on.<br/>
All of which, I believe, helped to purify some of my obscurations. </p>
<p>After the forty-nine days, when the Vajradhara went to Dralak Monastery<br/>
he brought me with him as his attendant.<br/>
In the breaks I memorized the <em>Guhyagarbha</em>,<br/>
and went around nomadic areas to collect supplies. </p>
<p>Having returned, I memorized the root text of the <em>Ornament of Clear Realization (AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra)</em>.<br/>
That winter I acted as regent during the <em>Gathered Great Assembly (tshogs chen âdus pa)</em>,<br/>
and, entering the tantric college,<br/>
I received a vast number of teachings, including<br/>
the <em>Ganggi LodrÃ¶ma</em> praise of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«,
<em>Praise of the Buddhaâs Superiority</em>, <em>More Exalted than the Gods</em>,
<em>Analysis of the Five Aggregates</em>, <em>Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life</em>,<br/>
the <em>Three Sets of Vows</em>, <em>Treasury of Precious Qualities</em>, <em>Wish-Fulfilling Treasury</em>,<br/>
<em>Introduction to Scholarship</em>, <em>Ornament of Clear Realization</em>, the two <em>Distinguishings</em>,
the <em>Sublime Continuum</em>, <em>Ornament of MahÄyÄna SÅ«tras (SÅ«trÄlaá¹kÄra)</em>, <em>Ornament of the Middle Way (MadhyamakÄlaá¹kÄra)</em> and more,<br/>
from Situ Paá¹chen, Khenpo Kunpal,<br/>
Tenzang, Aka and others.</p>
<p>The great khenpo Lama Kunzang Palden ChÃ¶drak was especially kind and caring<br/>
at this time, in explaining the difficult points of texts,<br/>
through which I developed a basic understanding of our inherited tradition. </p>
<p>Also in my fourteenth year I studied the textual tradition,<br/>
and on occasion joined the assembly to receive empowerments and transmissions,<br/>
observe the rainy season retreat, and so on. </p>
<p>During my fifteenth year, the incarnation from Dzongsar<br/>
departed for another realm,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a><br/>
and, according to the final testament of our predecessorâs ailing nephew,<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a><br/>
as transmitted to Lord Situ,<br/>
I, a sack of squandered offerings, had to move to the main seat. </p>
<p>Everyone left me and, all alone,<br/>
I had to take charge independently.<br/>
As a result of past negative karma,<br/>
some were unfriendly and hostile toward me.<br/>
But through the discipline of avoiding arrogance,<br/>
I ensured that the seat was not lost.<br/>
By adopting an attitude of great loving kindness,<br/>
I pacified hostility and won peopleâs hearts. </p>
<p>In accordance with the Lord of Refugeâs instructions,<br/>
I exerted myself in studies with Khenpo Kalzang Wangchuk<br/>
on those texts of Maitreya that I had not yet received,<br/>
as well as <em>Treasury of Abhidharma</em>, <em>Root Verses of the Middle Way</em>, <em>Introduction to the Middle Way</em>,<br/>
and <em>Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom</em>. </p>
<p>At this time, I taught around twenty monks of Dzongsar Monastery<br/>
<em>Introduction to the Bodhisattvaâs Way of Life</em>, the three sets of vows, <em>Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom</em>,<br/>
<em>Sublime Continuum</em> and <em>The Prayer of Good Actions</em>. </p>
<p>In the Earth Bird year, I went to visit Loter Wangpo,<br/>
the Vajradhara lord merely to think of whom dispels the heartâs anguish.<br/>
Delightedly, he invited me to sit upon a throne<br/>
bedecked with cushions of the finest brocade.<br/>
Through the force of past karmic connection,<br/>
I felt tremendous respect and ardent devotion toward him.<br/>
Before long, from both the Varjadhara himself<br/>
and Tashi of Drakra I began to receive<br/>
the major empowerments of the <em>Compendium of Tantras</em>.<br/>
The great lord of buddha families also bestowed a great many instructions<br/>
on <em>Parting from the Four Attachments</em> and <em>The Seven Points [of Mind Training]</em>.<br/>
He began with the generation of bodhicitta according to the Middle Way tradition<br/>
and the general maá¹á¸ala of the three families,<br/>
and, in all, I received many major empowerments.</p>
<p>I received the complete instruction of the <em>Path with Its Fruit for Disciples</em><br/>
and an elaboration explanation of the <em>Hevajra Tantra</em>.<br/>
When explaining the view of the indivisibility of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a<br/>
according to the causal continuum of the universal ground, during the teachings for disciples<br/>
he spent seven days on the pointing out instructions based on searching for the mind.<br/>
I thus gained a partial understanding of the essence of mind.<br/>
The great Vajradhara also held the profound ultimate lineage<br/>
of experiential guidance, the heart instructions of Nyoshul Lungtok TenpÃ© Nyima. </p>
<p>I was asked to explain the <em>Seven Points [of Mind Training]</em> to a group of aspiring practitioners<br/>
when Khenchen Shenpen Rinpoche was doing a major recap of the tantra teachings.<br/>
I also took responsibility for going over the first half of <em>The Tree of General Tantra Classifications</em>.<br/>
That master scholar also explained the <em>Fundamental Vinaya Summary</em>.<br/>
Tartse Khenchen could not come,<br/>
so, once the yoga tantra section was complete,<br/>
I received the <em>Hundred Transmissions of Mitra (Mitra Gyatsa)</em> and <em>Seven Ngor Maá¹á¸alas</em>,<br/>
the major Bhairava empowerments of the Ra and Tsarpa traditions,<br/>
as well as a triple instruction based on Ngawang ChÃ¶drakâs guide to Path with Its Fruit from Tashi Gyatso. </p>
<p>The transmission of the <em>Collection of Tantras</em> was delayed and, all in all, lasted about seven months.<br/>
Although my noble father, the great vidyÄdhara,<br/>
had arrived to transmit the <em>Treasury of Revelations</em>,<br/>
I had been deliberating which was the more important.<br/>
Eventually, I excused myself with great concern that he had stayed at Dzongsar for so long,<br/>
and, missing the deities and guru, I returned to my place at Tashi Lhatse. </p>
<p>Beginning on an astrologically auspicious day<br/>
in the month of miracles in the Iron Dog year,<br/>
my father conferred the series of major empowerments,<br/>
including the <em>Great Assembly</em>, <em>Emptying the Depths of Hell</em>,
and the whole of the New Treasures of Chokling.<br/>
For eight months in total, he bestowed empowerments and transmissions. </p>
<p><em>Noble guru whose kindness is beyond measure,<br/>
from now until I reach the essence of awakening,<br/>
O guru whose kindness is immeasurable,<br/>
to you I shall continually make offerings.</em> </p>
<p>In the Iron Pig, I received all the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions<br/>
for the <em>Compendium of SÄdhanas</em> from the king of Vajradharas,<br/>
Khenchen Samten LodrÃ¶, as well as the reading transmission for KhecarÄ«, and more. </p>
<p>That same year my noble father, the vidyÄdhara,<br/>
passed beyond and went to the realm of Lotus Light.<br/>
I made abundant cloud-like offerings to fulfil his intentions. </p>
<p>For more than four months in the Water Mouse year,<br/>
I received a great many empowerments from the <em>Compendium of Tantras</em>,<br/>
from the Highest Yoga section onwards,<br/>
from Tartse Zhabdrung Rinpoche Jampa Kunzang Tenpai Nyima of Wara Monastery.<br/>
This master was unrivalled in his qualities of learning, discipline and benevolence,<br/>
and the fact that he was unable to live long was deeply regrettable and a source of much distress. </p>
<p>From Kunzang Palden ChÃ¶drak, I received explanatory guidance on the <em>PramÄá¹avÄrttika</em>,<br/>
a commentary on the <em>KÄlacakra Tantra</em> and more. </p>
<p>The lord of scholars Tashi ChÃ¶pel demonstrated his incredible kindness many times,<br/>
by granting me the Golden Dharmas of the Shangpa, KÄlacakra and so on. </p>
<p>When I reached my twenty-fifth year, I went to tame the valley of Gonjo.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a><br/>
As this demonstrates, although I had returned to my seat,<br/>
I still took many trips in summer and winter to collect income. </p>
<p>Not allowing the gifts of the faithful to go to waste,<br/>
I established centres of study and practice,<br/>
and arranged for the writings of my predecessor<br/>
to be published in more than thirteen volumes.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a><br/>
Together with the three volumes of the KhecarÄ« collection,<br/>
the commentary on the <em>Gathering of Intentions SÅ«tra</em> and <em>á¹­ikka</em> for the <em>Guhyagarbha</em>,<br/>
more than two volumes of Miphamâs writing,<br/>
and other major texts and commentaries from sÅ«tra and mantra,<br/>
I have sponsored the printing of many volumes over the years. </p>
<p>In the Earth Horse, when I was twenty-five,<br/>
I established the great dharma teaching centre<br/>
of Shedrup Dargye Ling,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a><br/>
and through the magnanimous aspirations of Khenchen Shenpen JampÃ© Gocha,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a><br/>
it has continued without decline until the present.<br/>
In this way, I was of some slight benefit to the teachings. </p>
<p>That same year, while there was a medicine consecration at PukgÃ¶n Monastery<br/>
I went to Rudam Samten ChÃ¶ling [i.e., Dzogchen Monastery].<br/>
There, from Losal [i.e., Khenpo Jigme Pema Losal], who possesses the most excellent qualities of discipline and learning,<br/>
I received full ordination.<br/>
However, the auspicious conditions were only moderate. </p>
<p>It was during the Kagye medicine consecration at PukgÃ¶n Monastery<br/>
that I first beheld the golden visage of the Vajradhara Shechen Gyaltsab,<br/>
and received from him the <em>Gathering of the Innermost Essence</em> long-life initiation.<br/>
He was extraordinarily kind to me. </p>
<p>After that he came to Dzongsar, where he stayed for a long time<br/>
and bestowed many rare empowerments and transmissions<br/>
from the ancient terma tradition, including the Northern Treasures.</p>
<p>In the Earth Monkey year,<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> Gyaltsab Rinpoche<br/>
gave several empowerments and transmissions from the Mindroling tradition.
He fell sick and I offered prayers for his longevity. </p>
<p>I went to the Do encampment in the north,<br/>
and met the omniscient Tenpe Nyima.<br/>
He kindly bestowed the empowerments of <em>Assembly of VidyÄdharas (Rigdzin DÃ¼pa)</em> and <em>The Sealed Quintessence Guru SÄdhana (Ladrup TiklÃ© Gyachen)</em>,<br/>
gave me instructions on Longchen Nyingtik,<br/>
and taught the overview of the <em>Guhyagarbha</em>.<br/>
He constantly offered guidance and advice.<br/>
He gave me permission to transmit his writings<br/>
even without having received the oral transmission,<br/>
and looked after me with immense kindness. </p>
<p>I met Lerab Lingpa and received ripening empowerments and liberating instructions<br/>
from the VajrakÄ«la cycle and the <em>Essence of Liberation (grol thig)</em>.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a></p>
<p>In the Wood Mouse year,<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> when I was thirty-one,<br/>
at Tashi Demchok Ling hermitage<br/>
at the great Dharma centre of Shechen,<br/>
the lord of the maá¹á¸ala with the name of Padma[i.e., Shechen Gyaltsab.]<br/>
remained upon the lion throne<br/>
and in this excellent gathering of teacher and assembly<br/>
granted instructions for texts,<br/>
together with empowerments and supporting instructions,<br/>
related to the eight great chariots of the practice lineage<br/>
from <em>Treasury of Precious Instructions (Damngak DzÃ¶)</em>,<br/>
as well as ripening empowerment and liberating instructions<br/>
for the teachings with restriction seals from <em>Treasury of Terma Revelations</em>.</p>
<p>This lord of refuge, the wish-fulfilling jewel,<br/>
cared for me with great kindness on both a worldly and spiritual level.<br/>
He was an incomparable treasury of compassion. </p>
<p>From Pema DrimÃ© LodrÃ¶<br/>
I received the transmission for Kunzang Namgyalâs writings<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a><br/>
and the two systems of Nyingtik<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> as well as the empowerments for the <em>Great Assembly</em>,<br/>
and more besidesâa vast number of teachings and empowerments in all. </p>
<p>The retreat centre of Dragang, established by the former Dharma-king of Derge,<br/>
had fallen into disrepair.<br/>
I provided the retreatants with a stipend<br/>
of more than a hundred <em>dri</em> and thirty pieces of silver each,<br/>
and rebuilt their retreat cells.<br/>
I also established retreat places for the aural lineage<br/>
focussing mainly on the practice of the Path with Its Fruit. </p>
<p>Then, in the region of Khyungpo,<br/>
I was invited by the government official Wangnor,<br/>
and forged a dharmic connection<br/>
through the empowerments of the <em>Four-Part Heart-Essence</em> and so on. </p>
<p>In the Wood Ox year I went on pilgrimage to Lhasa,<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a><br/>
and prostrated myself and made offerings before the Jowo ÅÄkyamuni.<br/>
I made prayers of aspiration to my satisfaction,<br/>
and beheld the signs and marks of the Gyalwang Tupten Gyatso.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a><br/>
As a dharmic connection, I received teachings on <em>Lamp for the Path of Awakening</em>,<br/>
and offered earnest prayers for his longevity. </p>
<p>In keeping with the biography of my predecessor,<br/>
I went to the great dharma centre of Mindrolling,<br/>
to take the vows of full ordination again<br/>
from Ngawang Tupten Norbu. </p>
<p>One month that year I travelled to Khyungpo.<br/>
On the way I met Neten Chokling and Tsikey Tulku Rinpoche,<br/>
from whom I received several empowerments and teachings<br/>
including the New Treasures of Chokling. </p>
<p>In the year of the Water Ox<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a><br/>
I, the unfortunate one,<br/>
received the terrible news that the great omniscient Situ,<br/>
merely to think of whom dispels the miseries of existence and quiescence,<br/>
Had passed away.<br/>
I said prayers and made offerings for the fulfilment of his intentions.<br/>
for many years thereafter, I encountered him again in dreams. </p>
<p><em>Although you, my protector, have passed into the absolute sphere,<br/>
You continue, I am sure, to care for me with love.<br/>
And constantly I feel a sorrow that is tinged with joy.</em> </p>
<p>On the orders of the minister MentÃ¶,<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a><br/>
I travelled to Jampa Ling in Chamdo<br/>
and there performed a rite for averting Yama,<br/>
as well as the practice of the <em>sthaviras</em>, and so on.<br/>
I also offered empowerment and ritual ablution to the minister<br/>
and an explanatory reading transmission of the <em>Treasury of DharmadhÄtu (ChÃ¶ying DzÃ¶)</em>. </p>
<p>Around this time, I received several major empowerments<br/>
from the lord of scholars, Geshe Jampal Rolwe LodrÃ¶,<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a><br/>
including the great empowerment of GuhyasamÄja.<br/>
at the very top of the YamÄntaka temple.<br/>
He created the auspicious conditions for my long life<br/>
through the longevity practice of Cakrasaá¹vara. </p>
<p>After returning to my own place,<br/>
I sent my regards and a greeting scarf<br/>
to Shechen, for Kyabje Gyaltsab Rinpoche.<br/>
In his handwritten response, he wrote:<br/>
âNow the mahÄpaá¹á¸ita Katok Situ has passed away,<br/>
and I too am an old man close to death.<br/>
The oil in the lamp of the Nyingma teachings is all but spent,<br/>
so it is right for you to summon your courage<br/>
and prepare yourself to serve the teachings.â<br/>
This was to be his final message.<br/>
He passed into the absolute sphere shortly afterwards. </p>
<p>I travelled to perform the fulfilment of his intentions,<br/>
and one night while staying in Pawok, I met the master in a dream.<br/>
Until the end of the third week I made cloud-like offerings<br/>
and prayed repeatedly for the fulfilment of his intentions.<br/>
I also performed the cremation and so on. </p>
<p>From the great khenpo Kunzang Palden,<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a><br/>
I received instruction on generating bodhicitta according to the <em>Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life</em>.<br/>
Then, returning to my own place, I immediately went into retreat. </p>
<p>After the retreat, I went to glorious Katok.<br/>
and oversaw elaborate repairs to the study college,<br/>
where we added new sacred imagery.<br/>
Then, with my own resources and whatever was leftover,<br/>
we built a temple to house a great buddha statue,<br/>
both the external structure and sacred objects within. </p>
<p>The Fifth Dzogchen Rinpoche had passed away,<br/>
and when his tulku appeared, I officiated at the enthronement,<br/>
performing the offering of praise and so on,<br/>
without any agenda based on self-interest. </p>
<p>At around the time of my fifteenth year,<br/>
I went to be of service to the teachings at Katok.<br/>
In my free time during that period,<br/>
I performed many approach and accomplishment recitations,<br/>
including the major approach recitation for Hevajra. </p>
<p>At the feet of GatÃ¶n Lekpa,<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a><br/>
sovereign of all holders of the aural lineage, Dharma Lord and Vajradhara,<br/>
I received an explanation of the profound private instructions<br/>
of the Path with Its Fruit according to the oral tradition, complete with the four valid criteria,<br/>
as well as KhecarÄ«, YamÄntaka, MahÄkÄla and so onâ<br/>
many profound ripening empowerments and liberating instructions from the oral lineage.<br/>
He was extremely kind and entrusted me with his wisdom intent. </p>
<p>The precious guru of incomparable kindness<br/>
established a new tradition elaborate KÄ«la practice at Dzongsar,<br/>
and erected many supports of enlightened body, speech and mind,<br/>
as well as establishing a little retreat centre at Taktsang.<br/>
At some point, I performed many great accomplishment (<em>drupchen</em>) practices,<br/>
and, in accordance with the vision of the all-seeing Situ,<br/>
helped to popularize the great âHundred Million Maá¹i Mantraâ practice<br/>
throughout the neighbouring regions,<br/>
where it became a basis for happiness and wellbeing. </p>
<p>I will now detail some other Dharma connections<br/>
I made at various times through the speech of great masters. </p>
<p>I received many empowerments and teachings<br/>
from the great khenpo Gyaltsen Ãzer.<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a><br/>

he enveloped me in tremendous kindness. </p>

his beneficial activity was weak on account of his stubborn character. </p>

I received the Cause and Path Hevajra and NairÄtmyÄ empowerments,<br/>

and I felt the blessings of his realization, sparking the power of awareness. </p>

I received the empowerment for Guru Cakrasaá¹vara and much else. </p>
<p>Although I barely had the fortune to meet the Fifteenth Gyalwang Karmapa,<br/>
I did encounter him in dreams.<br/>
Still, I beheld the radiant visage of his incarnation, the Sixteenth, RigpÃ© Dorje.<br/>

and all the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions for Four-Faced MahÄkÄla. </p>
<p>From Jamyang Khyenrab TayÃ©,<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a><br/>

and reading transmissions for Vajrabhairava and Four-Faced MahÄkÄla. </p>
<p>From Tharlam Tulku Rinpoche<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a><br/>

<p>From Namkha Kunzang Tenpe Gyaltsen,<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a><br/>
I received empowerments and authorization blessings<br/>

From Shar Lama KÃ¶nchok Tendzin I received<br/>
all the authorization blessings and detailed instructions for PaÃ±jaranÄtha,<br/>
and the authorization blessing for <em>White TÄrÄ Radiating Six Rays of Light</em>.</p>
<p>In short, by relying on more than eighty teachers,<br/>
I received a vast array of sacred Dharma. </p>
<p>Beginning in my forty-eighth year, I was afflicted<br/>
with a severe condition that lasted several years.<br/>
Through the compassion of the guru and Three Jewels<br/>
I managed to remain alive. </p>
<p>Due to my heavy obscurations from evil karma and misuse of funds,<br/>
I have not had any visions of the Three Root deities,<br/>
experiences of receiving teachings from them and the like,<br/>
so there is nothing whatsoever to write down. </p>
<p>My diligence is weak and my intelligence slight.<br/>
I retain only a little with mediocre understanding.<br/>
Had I been trained in the principles of logic,<br/>
I believe I might have become flawless in debate,<br/>
but there is little point in that. </p>
<p>I was able to memorize <em>Chanting the Names of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«</em>,<br/>
as well as the sÄdhanas of the Three Roots<br/>
and <em>MagÃ¶n Chamdral</em> from Longchen Nyingtik,<br/>
in addition to several recitations for assembly practice in the Ngor tradition,<br/>
having chanted them only two or three times.<br/>
I believe this was due to positive habitual traces from past lives. </p>
<p>When memorizing the <em>VajravidÄraá¹a</em> dhÄraá¹Ä«<br/>
one evening, as I gazed at the moon,<br/>
I felt intense sadness and repeatedly recalled<br/>
the great dharma centre of glorious Sakya,<br/>
and how I had been born in the KhÃ¶n family<br/>
In a previous lifeâ<br/>
a fleeting memory based on habitual traces. </p>
<p>On occasion I have also had fragmentary recollections<br/>
of Ngari Paá¹chen, the great LhatsÃ¼n,<br/>
Ngawang Lobzang Gyatso,<br/>
Tsangyang Gyatso, Palri Khyentse<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a> and others.<br/>
These were my own wild imaginings<br/>
based on excessive pride,<br/>
as it would clearly be unreasonable<br/>
for such sublime masters as these<br/>
to take birth as one so wicked as I. </p>
<p>When I was young I had a dream<br/>
in which I was cared for by the mantra protectress.<br/>
I reported this to the lord of the maá¹á¸ala,<br/>
who said I should recite Longsal Nyingpoâs mantra protectress. </p>
<p>Thangtong Gyalpo introduced me to the nature of pure awareness<br/>
with the support of a crystal.<br/>
In dreams I met the noble elder Aá¹gaja,<br/>
as well as Vimalamitra and Longchenpa.<br/>
I received long-life empowerment from Khyentse Wangpo<br/>
and an explanatory transmission of the Longchen Nyingtik preliminaries<br/>
from the great bodhisattva Patrul. </p>
<p>Nubchen Sangye Yeshe gave me the entrustments<br/>
for many tantric works.<br/>
I had dreams and experiences of receiving blessings<br/>
from several lamas from the Path with Its Fruit lineage,<br/>
as well as Milarepa, Sakya Paá¹á¸ita, Tsongkhapa,<br/>
and LhatsÃ¼n Namkha Jigme,<br/>
who showed me the indications for mantra conduct.<br/>
I couldnât tell whether these were real or false;<br/>
they were like confused blurs.<br/>
And because I did not cling to self,<br/>
I donât recall them in precise detail. </p>
<p>Although I wished to practise approach and accomplishment<br/>
for the Three Root deities of the new and old schools and <em>kama</em> and <em>terma</em> traditions,<br/>
as desperately as someone afflicted with thirst would yearn for water,<br/>
still I have been overwhelmed by the eight worldly concerns. </p>
<p>I have managed the following, more or less: </p>
<p>While young, I practised the praise to MaÃ±juÅrÄ«,<br/>
and recited it for about a month,<br/>
but was mostly lost in distraction. </p>
<p>I accumulated 300,000 recitations of White MaÃ±juÅrÄ«<br/>
and 500,000 approach mantras for SarasvatÄ«,<br/>
but this involved a lot of thinking and very little application of the key points. </p>
<p>I did the daily recitation for Ratna Lingpaâs <em>Secret SÄdhana of VajrakÄ«la</em>,
White VajravÄrÄhÄ« from Koá¹kadattaâs tradition,<br/>
and the mind treasure, <em>Illuminating Wisdom (PrajÃ±Älokaká¹tya)</em>.<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a></p>
<p>I also completed the recitations for wrathful <em>Takhyung Barwa</em>, Siá¹hamukhÄ,<br/>
the <em>Sealed Quintessence (TiklÃ© Gyachen)</em> guru practice and VajrakÄ«la.</p>
<p>I twice practised the <em>Enhancer of Longevity</em> Four-Faced MahÄkÄla.<br/>
I did the hundred thousand accumulations of the Longchen Nyingtik preliminaries,<br/>
but could not complete more than 40,000 prostrations.</p>
<p>I practised the major approach for Hevajra elaborately,<br/>
BhÅ«taá¸Ämara, Mitraâs [White] AmitÄyus according to both Kama and Terma,<br/>
the <em>Secret-Essence (Sangtik) KÄ«la</em> twice,<br/>
the <em>Aural Transmission (NyengyÃ¼) KÄ«la</em>,<br/>
both VajrakÄ«la and YamÄntaka from the Clear Light Heart-Essence (Ãsal Nyingtik),<br/>
the Chokling KÄ«la: <em>The Wrathful King in Whom All Power is Gathered</em>,<br/>
Longsal Nyingpoâs VajrapÄá¹i and Yellow Jambhala,<br/>
DÃ¼dul Dorjeâs Secret Practice of KÄ«la and <em>Palchen DÃ¼pa</em>,<br/>
the extensive recitation for the <em>Tantra System MaÃ±juÅrÄ«</em>,<br/>
Dorje DrolÃ¶ from the Sangwa Gyachen,<br/>
Karma Guru, White TÄrÄ,<br/>
and <em>Extracting the Vital Essences</em>,<br/>
Makzor, Long-life Practice General Maá¹á¸ala of the Three Families,<br/>
<em>Lama SangdÃ¼</em> and <em>KÃ¶nchok ChidÃ¼,</em><br/>
<em>Barche Kunsel</em>, <em>Sampa Lhundrup,</em>
and TÄrÄ who Dispels Obstacles,<br/>
TÄrÄ, VajrapÄá¹Ä« and Ucchuá¹£ma,
Nyangâs <em>Gathering of Sugatas</em>, <em>Gathering of Eight Deities (KagyÃ©)</em>,<br/>
and the Yamantaka from the Aural Transmission twice. </p>
<p>I have also practised the <em>Vanquisher of Opponents (Parol Goljom)</em> twice,<br/>
Vijaya from the Bari tradition,<br/>
the <em>Heart-Essence of Deathless Ärya TÄra (ChimÃ© PakmÃ© Nyingtik)</em> three times,<br/>
the Vimalamitra guru sÄdhana <em>Heart of Blessings</em>,<br/>
and the <em>Immaculate Sage</em> twice. </p>
<p>I have practised the Red AmitÄyus heart practice and Red Kiá¹kara,<br/>
the âfurther avertingâ practice from the Essence of Liberation, NÄgaraká¹£a,<br/>
White TÄrÄ from AtiÅaâs tradition and from Zhikpo Lingpa,<br/>
White TÄrÄ from the Longchen Nyingtik and the Bari tradition twice,<br/>
the White Six-Armed protector,<br/>
Vajrasattva from the Mindrolling tradition, the Wrathful Red Deity <em>(Drakmar)</em>,<br/>
Dorje DrolÃ¶ from the Heart Practice,<br/>
Dorje Drakdzongma, guardian of PaÃ±jaranÄtha, three times,<br/>
and I recited the seven syllables of PaÃ±jaranÄtha<br/>
around eight million times. </p>
<p>I believe that this form of MahÄkÄla<br/>
has always looked upon me with compassion.<br/>
When restoring the protector temple at Dzing Namgyal monastery,<br/>
at the time of dispersing obstacles during the consecration,<br/>
through the force of sharpening the power of awareness<br/>
the statue of the deity actually shook,<br/>
as I and several others witnessed. </p>
<p>I accumulated two million recitations of Sakya KÄ«la,<br/>
and practised the <em>VidyÄdhara Heir of the Victorious Ones (Gyalwe Dungdzin)</em> from the Heart Practice,<br/>
as well as <em>Guru: Lion of Speech</em> from Padampaâs tradition,<br/>
Lion of Speech, the daily practice for the entire maá¹á¸ala<br/>
of <em>Gathering of the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ Secrets (Khandro SangdÃ¼)</em>,<br/>

<p>I also practised <em>Pacifying Torment</em> from the Essence of Liberation,<br/>
KurukullÄ from the Sakya tradition, KhecarÄ«,<br/>
the two systems of Thangtong Gyalpoâs long-life practice,<br/>
the guru yoga of Six-Armed Blue MahÄkÄla,<br/>
the secret practice of glorious Four-Faced MahÄkÄla,<br/>
and ten thousand recitations of SitÄtapatrÄ. </p>
<p>Guru yoga based on the three long-life deities,<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[45]</a><br/>
Kyergangâs HayagrÄ«va, Multi-Coloured Garuá¸a, Black MaÃ±juÅrÄ«,<br/>
VajrapÄá¹i in Utsarya and Blue-Clad <em>(NÄ«lÄmbaradhara)</em> forms,<br/>
Sakyaâs combined form of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«, <a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a><br/>
SamantaÅrÄ«âs SarasvatÄ«,<br/>
Brahmin KÄ«laâs tradition of SarasvatÄ«,<br/>
Bhiká¹£aparamaâs secret practice of Red SarasvatÄ«,<br/>
Ucchuá¹£ma in AtiÅaâs tradition,<br/>
<em>Dispelling the Faults of Samaya Defilements</em> <em>(Damdrip Nyepa Kunsel)</em> from the Essence of Liberation tradition,<br/>
White Acala, the main deity Green TÄrÄ from SÅ«ryaguptaâs tradition,<br/>
Red Jambhala, the Seven-Gur long-life practice of Four-Faced MahÄkÄla,<br/>

and the long-life practice of Kurava. </p>
<p>I also practised Nyangâs KrodhikÄlÄ«,<br/>

the HayagrÄ«va practice of the aural transmission of

Wrathful Guru with the Lower Part as a Dagger from the Sky Teachings (NamchÃ¶),<br/>
Guru SÄdhana from the Quintessence of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
and the long-life practice called <em>The Iron Tree</em>. </p>
<p>I practised the Ling treasure of the long-life consort (<em>tseyum</em>)<br/>
and Khyentseâs Caá¹á¸ÄlÄ« twice.<br/>
I also completed the approach and accomplishment recitations<br/>
for Choklingâs Siá¹hamukhÄ of Vimalamitra,<br/>
Guru ChÃ¶wangâs White TÄrÄ and so on. </p>
<p>All this was done as in the statement,<br/>
âWith a mind that is distracted,<br/>
however much you recite, it will bear no fruit.â<br/>
I did not gain even so much as a sign of common accomplishment. </p>
<p>Still, as long as death does not catch up with me,<br/>
I shall practise a little more approach and accomplishment.<br/>
So that I might gain accomplishment in this wayâ<br/>
Lord of Oá¸á¸iyÄna, grant me inspiration and blessings, I pray! </p>
<p>I do not possess the ten requisite qualities<br/>
of an outer or inner vajra master.<br/>
Nor have I practised the approach recitation<br/>
for the great tantra classes on a vast scale.<br/>
Still, with arrogant presumptuousness,<br/>
and in response to requests, I have taken on the burden of being a guru. </p>
<p>Thus, I have given the <em>Treasury of Instructions (Damngak DzÃ¶)</em> three times, the <em>Compendium of SÄdhanas</em> four times,<br/>
the empowerments and reading transmissions of the great <em>Treasury of Terma Revelations,</em><br/>
and the private instructions for the Path with Its Fruit once,<br/>
the public instructions twice, teachings on the <em>Hevajra Tantra</em> three times,<br/>
explanatory transmission of the root tantras of Gur and Sampuá¹­a,<br/>
and with great effort, I twice received<br/>
the explanation as taught in Khyentseâs close lineage.</p>
<p>I taught the Seven Maá¹á¸alas of Ngor three times,<br/>
the maá¹á¸ala of the <em>Purification of All Evil Destinies (SarvadurgatipariÅodhana)</em> three times,<br/>
I taught the Jonang and Zhalu intepretations of KÄlacakra six times,
and Miphamâs commentary on the tantra once.<br/>
I also transmitted the Cakrasaá¹vara according to Luipaâs and Nagpopaâs traditions many times,<br/>
and the aural lineage of Cakrasaá¹vara once. </p>
<p>I gave the empowerment and reading transmission for KhecarÄ« VajrayoginÄ« many times<br/>
and the reading transmission for the collected rituals <em>(beâu bum)</em> twice.<br/>
I conferred the collected works of the Sakya patriarchs and Ngorchen once,<br/>
and the empowerments and reading transmission of PaÃ±jaranÄtha and Four-Faced MahÄkÄla twice.<br/>
I gave the textual transmission of Bhairava once<br/>
and the empowerments several times.</p>
<p>I gave the reading transmission for the <em>Great Stages of the Path (Lamrim Chenmo)</em> once,<br/>
for the Nyingma Kama twice,<br/>
and for the Nyingma Tantra Collection once. </p>
<p>I gave the major texts from the Kamaâ<br/>
<em>Guhyagarbha</em>, the <em>General Scripture</em>,<br/>
and the <em>Root Fragment</em> tantra [of VajrakÄ«la]â<br/>
four times and the ripening empowerments<br/>
for the section with restriction seals from the <em>Treasury of Precious Termas</em> three times<br/>
and the reading transmission twice.<br/>
I transmitted the <em>Four-Part Heart-Essence</em> three times,<br/>
and the two Quintessences twice. </p>
<p>I gave the reading transmission for the Seven Treasuries twice,<br/>
and explained the Trilogy of Finding Rest many times.<br/>
I gave the major empowerment of <em>Lama GongdÃ¼</em> twice,<br/>
and the major KagyÃ© empowerment the same number of times.<br/>
I transmitted <em>Gongpa Zangthal</em> twice,<br/>
and Thangtong NyengyÃ¼ three times. </p>
<p>I gave the Sealed pure visions [of the Fifth Dalai Lama]<br/>
and the Mindrolling Treasures three or four times each. </p>
<p>I have given the <em>Excellent Wish-Granting Vase (DÃ¶jo Bumzang)</em> twice,<br/>
and the reading transmission for the writings of Minling Terchen and Tsele Natsok Rangdrol once each.<br/>
I gave the empowerments and reading transmissions for the revelations of DÃ¼dul Dorje and Longsal Nyingpo twice and the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions<br/>
for the Longchen Nyingtik many times,<br/>
as well as teaching on the <em>Treasury of Precious Qualities</em> three times. </p>
<p>I bestowed the entire terma collection of Khyentse Wangpo<br/>
and the reading transmission for his writings twice.<br/>
And I transmitted the entire New Treasures of Chokling twice as well. </p>
<p>In short, in response to various requests,<br/>
and according to peopleâs wishes, I have offered an uninterrupted stream<br/>
of Dharma teachings, empowerments, authorizations, blessings and instructions. </p>
<p>My predecessor, the JamgÃ¶n Lama,<br/>
had a maternal care for all traditions,<br/>
and understood their own unique systems<br/>
of tantra, commentary and pith instruction, without ever conflating them. </p>
<p>He did not spoil traditions by combining them,<br/>
but taught all disciples according to their needs.<br/>
Thus, all schoolsâSakya, Gelug, KagyÃ¼ and Nyingmaâ<br/>
cherished him as one of their own gurus. </p>
<p>Although I am not of similar calibre,<br/>
still I have cultivated pure perception extensively<br/>
towards all the eight great chariots of Tibet,<br/>
and remain untainted by the veil of false ideas,<br/>
while also avoiding disparagement and sectarian bias. </p>
<p>I pray that whatever traditions of empowerment, instruction and reading transmission remain,<br/>
I may, with great effort,<br/>
receive them all, now and in the future! </p>
<p>Whatever I have received with the noble intention<br/>
that the teachings may endure long into the future,<br/>
may I be able to pass on without sectarian prejudice,<br/>
and may I abandon all criticism and jealousy<br/>
and contempt for beings, irrespective of their status. </p>
<p>Thus, with the wish to benefit all,<br/>
an intention as pure as a white conch or lotus root,<br/>
I generated bodhicitta and made positive prayers of aspiration.<br/>
May all the connections I have made be meaningful. </p>
<p>This is the essence of my life of liberation. </p>
<p>Now that I have reached the age of fifty-sixâ<br/>
half-a-century plus the sense enjoyments and a rhino horn,<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a><br/>
although I lack even the tiniest attribute<br/>
of a treasure-revealer or adept,<br/>
if, for the time being, I continue to survive,<br/>
it is possible that as I try to secure my own interest,<br/>
I might also be of some slight benefit to others. </p>
<p>Therefore, in accordance with indirect statements<br/>
from the all-seeing lord, my predecessor,<br/>
as well as the prophecies of great beings,<br/>
including some words of the great JamgÃ¶n Kongtrul,<br/>
and that which arose to my own mind,<br/>
circumstances came about whereby I took a consort for long-life practice. </p>
<p>I gave back my basic vehicle vows of individual liberation,<br/>
and now I may not gain the realization on which they depend.<br/>
Still, with bodhicitta I persist in virtuous action.<br/>
Although I cannot promise that this will prove beneficial,<br/>
as long as I do not fall prey to inner or outer conditions,<br/>
for a while at least, it is possible that I shall survive. </p>
<p>With the great burden of negativity I have accumulated,<br/>
the infallible laws of cause and effect prescribe<br/>
that I must experience suffering as a result.<br/>
Thus, I call out to the compassionate protectors:<br/>
Please look kindly upon this wretched one<br/>
And lead him out of miseryâs mire! </p>
<p>Infractions of the major and minor rules<br/>
of the three sets of vows shower down like rain,<br/>
and I am stained by natural misdeeds as well.<br/>
With deep and heartfelt regret, I recall<br/>
and confess these faults: purify them all, I pray! </p>
<p>I lack the confidence to delight in death,<br/>
and however much of this human life remains,<br/>
may I devote it all to Dharma practice.<br/>
In particular, through the altruistic mind of bodhicitta,<br/>
as stable as the king of mountains,<br/>
may I fulfil the wishes of all beings<br/>
and secure their genuine welfare! </p>
<p>Whatever remains unfulfilled in the aspirations and activity<br/>
of the all-seeing protector Jamyang Khyentse,<br/>
that great and precious treasury of wisdom and love,<br/>
may I be the one to accomplish it all! </p>
<p>May I and all who are connected with me,<br/>
even those who have merely heard my name,<br/>
purify all karma, afflictions, misdeeds and obscurations,<br/>
and take birth miraculously in the heart of a lotus<br/>
in the western pureland of SukhÄvatÄ«.<br/>
There, may we attain the prophecy of awakening,<br/>
traverse the five paths and ten stages,<br/>
and gain the four kÄyas of omniscience! </p>
<p>Thus, I offer this rough summary<br/>
of my own past deeds,<br/>
in which I conceal my flaws<br/>
and exaggerate my qualities. </p>
<p>I wrote this brief account<br/>
as I could not turn down the request<br/>
of the all-seeing supreme tulku,<br/>
the precious Tashi Paljor,<br/>
with whom I have been connected in past lives<br/>
through the force of a common aspiration. </p>
<p>Thus, this old fool and wanderer, who has abandoned both kinds of pursuit,<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a><br/>
the so-called ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶âDharmic Intelligence,<br/>
spontaneously wrote down whatever came to mind.<br/>
May the virtue of this be a cause of progress toward liberation<br/>
in all those who have a positive or negative connection! </p>
<p>(I made a few additions when devoted students were preparing to carve the woodblocks.) </p>
<p><em>May virtue abound! Sarva maá¹galam.</em></p>
