	<h2>The Vajra Words Unveiled</h2>
<h3>A Commentary on the <em>DÃ¼sum SangyÃ©</em> Prayer to the Guru</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Jamyang Khyentse ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Lotus-Born, Exalted Lotus,<br/>
Lotus King, to you I bowâ<br/>
á¸ÄkinÄ«s, please grant permission<br/>
To unveil these vajra words!</em> </p>
<p>The <em><a href="/tibetan-masters/chokgyur-dechen-lingpa/prayer-in-six-vajra-lines">DÃ¼sum SangyÃ©</a></em> prayer can be explained according to three types of meanings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The outer, literal meaning,</li>
<li>The inner, hidden meaning,</li>
<li>The secret, ultimate meaning.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>1. The Outer, Literal Meaning</h3>
<p>The explanation of this prayer, beginning with &quot;Embodiment of buddhas of past, present and future, Guru Rinpoche&quot; (<em>dÃ¼ sum sangyÃ© guru rinpochÃ©</em>), is as follows. At the beginning of time, when there were neither sentient beings nor buddhas, there was the teacher, dharmakÄya Samantabhadra, the forebear of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a. By his blessing arose the five sambhogakÄya families, and from them infinitely vast cloud-banks of pure lands, such as GhanavyÅ«ha. Then, the supreme peaceful and wrathful nirmÄá¹akÄya emanations, the vidyÄdharas, vÄ«ras and yoginÄ«s appeared in infinite forms to teach disciples according to their capacities, whether inferior or superior.</p>
<p>As the Guru's vajra words proclaim: &quot;'Self-manifested Padma'âthis is what I am called...&quot;<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> One of his infinite emanations appeared in, of the four continents of the world, our Jambu continent.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> To the west of the Vajra Seat at Jambu's center lies Uá¸á¸iyÄna, which is Apabhraá¹Åa for &quot;the land of the sky dancers.&quot; And it was upon the Sindhu Ocean to the northwest of Uá¸á¸iyÄna (corrupted to &quot;Orgyen&quot;) that this great master took miraculous birth.</p>
<p>Among the inconceivable number of deeds in his liberating life-stories, most importantly the Guru undertook an infinite variety of beneficial deeds for the sake of the teachings and beings in Tibet, the land of snows. Upon one such occasion, the Guru bestowed upon his principal disciples, especially the Dharma King and his heirs, this prayer of vajra words, the very sound of the dharmatÄ. The meaning of this prayer may be explained as follows.</p>
<p>The Guru encompasses the complete abandonment and realization of all the <strong>buddhas</strong> (<em>sangyÃ©</em>) who have come, will come, and presently reside in the <strong>three times</strong> (<em>dÃ¼ sum</em>) of past, present and future. He is a manifestation of every one of these tathÄgatas who have perfected the twofold benefit, and he embodies their blessings. This <strong>precious</strong> <strong>master</strong> (<em>guru rinpochÃ©</em>) from Uá¸á¸iyÄna, then, is equal in qualities to a mighty king who fulfils all wishes. He has the power to effortlessly grant <strong>all</strong> the excellent supreme and ordinary <strong>siddhis</strong> (<em>ngÃ¶drub kÃ¼n</em>) for the sake of this life and the next. Thus, the Guru is a <strong>lord</strong> (<em>dak</em>) whose glory is universal among all the beings within existence and peace, and his power to bestow siddhis upon those with faith, devotion, and good fortune, is unequalled.</p>
<p>Of the infinite names by which he is known throughout all the various realms, outwardly he is primarily Padmasambhava, the great guru of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.</p>
<p>Inwardly, since the Guru has transcended all defiled phenomena and completely overcome all forms of attachment within the three realms of existence, he has attained complete mastery over the kingdom of unsurpassable, unified <strong>great bliss</strong> (<em>dewa chenpÃ¶</em>). The Guru is therefore superior to all ordinary beings, ÅrÄvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, and his realization is one with all the tathÄgatas. At the <strong>feet</strong> (<em>shab</em>) of such a being, we prostrate with devotion.</p>
<p>Secretly, he <strong>dispels all</strong> the <strong>obstacles</strong> (<em>barchÃ© kÃ¼n sel</em>), whether they be: on the outer level, the eight or sixteen dangers; on the inner level, the concepts related to the five poisons, and the destructive diseases and evil spirits they give rise to; or, on the secret level, the blockages of the channels, winds and bindus. The Guru, in <strong>defeating</strong> our enemies, the four <strong>mÄras</strong> (<em>dÃ¼dul</em>), is totally courageous; he is a <strong>Mighty Wrathful King</strong> (<em>drakpo tsal</em>), majestic in his victory upon every front. Although the Guru does not waver from peace, out of his compassion he appears to intractable beings as extremely wrathful, an embodiment of the force and strength of all the wrathful kings.</p>
<p>With all our heart <strong>we pray</strong> (<em>solwa deb so</em>) to the Guru, the great master of Uá¸á¸iyÄna: &quot;With your awakened vajra body, speech, and mind, <strong>inspire us with your blessing</strong> (<em>jingyi lab tu sol</em>); ripen and liberate our minds! <strong>Pacify</strong> all the aforementioned <strong>outer, inner</strong>, and <strong>secret</strong> <strong>obstacles</strong> (<em>chi nang sangwÃ© barchÃ© shyiwa dang</em>) towards accomplishing enlightenment, without exception! Without resorting to strenuous effort and upon our merest wish, may all of <strong>our aspirations</strong> (<em>sampa</em>), particularly those that accord with the Dharmaâall that is meaningful in this life and the nextâ<strong>be spontaneously fulfilled</strong> (<em>lhÃ¼n gyi drubpar jingyi lob</em>), as naturally and easily as rivers flowing into the sea!&quot; Thus, we invoke the Guru's sacred vow by means of our prayer.</p>
<h3>2. The Inner, Hidden Meaning</h3>
<p>The <strong>three times</strong> (<em>dÃ¼ sum</em>) refers to the inner structure of the physical vajra body. <em>Past</em> refers to the heating and diminishing, or setting, of the essential constituents<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> caused by the solar winds. These course through the red <em>rasanÄ</em> channel on the right side, one of the three principal channels. Thus, <em>past</em> indicates the setting or extinguishing of the spoiled solar [wind]. <em>Present</em> refers to the growth of the essential constituents, or the soothing and cooling of their coarse aspects, caused by the lunar winds which course through the white <em>lalanÄ</em> channel on the left side. Thus, <em>present</em> indicates the settling and growth of the lunar aspect, which gives rise to bliss.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> In <em>rÄhu</em>, the central <em>avadhÅ«ti</em> channel, the wisdom winds flow. <em>Future</em> means when the wind-dependent mind and the bindus have entered <em>rÄhu</em>, and the solar and lunar winds have thereby been consumed, so that great, non-conceptual wisdom takes birth within one's being.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the pure white element [of the physical vajra body] is the awakened vajra body of the buddhas, the red element is awakened vajra speech, and non-conceptuality is awakened vajra mind. These are the primordially, naturally pure <strong>buddha</strong> (<em>sangyÃ©</em>), the <strong>precious master</strong> (<em>guru rinpochÃ©</em>), who is heavy with all the enlightened qualities and who transcends all that is to be attained or abandoned. At such a [primordial] time, this great being intrinsically abides beyond increase or decrease, transference or change.</p>
<p>At the time of the path, one applies the key instructions to the physical vajra body, consisting of the channels and the winds and bindus that course within them. All the qualities of the paths and bhÅ«mis are thereby produced and perfected instantaneously. Moreover, these qualities being primordially and spontaneously perfected, without needing to be sought anywhere else, is <strong>precious</strong> (<em>rinpochÃ©</em>). The <strong>master of all</strong> supreme and common <strong>siddhis</strong> (<em>ngÃ¶drub kÃ¼n dak</em>) is <strong>great bliss</strong> (<em>dewa chenpo</em>) [which is produced as follows]. Below the navel resides the essence of the red element, or inner heat (<em>caá¹á¸ÄlÄ«</em>), in the form of an 'a'-stroke (<span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">à¼</span>) which has the nature of fire. At the crown resides the essence of the white element in the form the <em>haá¹</em> syllable (<span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">à½§à¾</span>) which has the nature of lunar nectar.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> Through igniting the blissful warmth of blazing and dripping, a sublime and immutable great bliss pervades the entire body and mind with melting pleasure. Illustrative wisdom is thereby born within one's being, and through gradually perfecting habituation to this, the ultimate wisdom (that which is to be illustrated) forcefully arises within one's being.</p>
<p>When practicing in this way, the hindrances and <strong>obstacles</strong> (<em>barchÃ©</em>) that disturb the channels, winds, and bindus are <strong>all dispelled</strong> (<em>kÃ¼n sel</em>), and the crooked <strong>demons</strong> of the fiery winds within the <em>lalanÄ</em> and <em>rasanÄ</em> are <strong>conquered</strong> (<em>dÃ¼ dul</em>). While one is applying these forceful yogic exercises to the physical vajra body and thus allowing the body's channels to be naturally purified: physically practice flowing, soaring, exhausting, and dropping; verbally practice the long and short &quot;<em>ha</em>&quot; as well as the drawing of the <em>hÅ«á¹</em>; and apply the key points mentally. Purifying the winds in this way brings thoughts forcefully to a halt within the <em>avadhÅ«ti</em> channel.</p>
<p>By becoming accustomed to this training, body, speech, and mind will ripen into the three self-existing vajras. This city of the physical vajra body embodies the outer, inner, and secret Guru, which in <em>Hevajra</em> is referred to as &quot;great wisdom,&quot; and in <em>The Magical Net [of Vajrasattva]: Mirror [of All Secrets]</em> as &quot;the indestructible bindu.&quot; The entire maá¹á¸ala of deities of the outer practice of the BarchÃ© KÃ¼nsel are physically present and are generated as such. This is the explanation according to the generation stage of MahÄyoga. The maá¹á¸ala of the inner practice of Dewa Chenpo and Sampa LhÃ¼ndrup are present as the channels and bindus. This is the explanation according to Anuyoga. The secret practice, the self-existing wrath of DorjÃ© Drakpo Tsal, arises as the maá¹á¸ala of the innate dharmatÄ indivisible from awareness. This is the explanation according to the Atiyoga. In this section my intention has been to explain the generation phase practices according to three yogas and link them with the hidden meaning of the perfection phase.</p>
<h3>3. The Secret, Ultimate Meaning</h3>
<p>The <strong>three times</strong> (<em>dÃ¼ sum</em>) applies to the body, speech and mind. The <em>past</em> is reflected in the momentariness of the body, which is subject to birth and death. The <em>present</em> is reflected in speechâthe inhalation and exhalation of airâbased upon which the body and mind remain. The mind produces the proliferation of <em>future</em> dualistic thoughts and saá¹sÄra. Their relative importance is thus taught.</p>
<p>In the fourth time transcending these <strong>three times</strong> (<em>dÃ¼ sum</em>), the time of equality, resides the lord of the original ground, the glorious self-existing <strong>buddha</strong> (<em>sangyÃ©</em>), the forefather of all the tathÄgatas: <strong>Guru</strong> (<em>guru</em>) Samantabhadra. He is all-pervasive, unobstructed and unobscured, the universal embodiment of the wisdom of dharmadhÄtu, for he pervades all of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a and transcends all attributes; of mirror-like wisdom, for his verbal clarity illuminates all phenomena of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a; equality, for existence and peace are for him of a single taste; and the great wisdom of discernment, for he distinguishes all phenomena. Originally and naturally pure, his qualities complete from the very beginning, he is <strong>precious</strong> (<em>rinpochÃ©</em>).</p>
<p>Siddhis, meaning <strong>attainments</strong> (<em>ngÃ¶ drup</em>), refers to the Guru's all-accomplishing wisdom, and implies that this <strong>great being</strong> (<em>kun dak</em>) brings total and complete benefit to all sentient beings within existence and peace. The king of self-knowing awareness, the teacher Unchanging Light, is endowed with the supreme of all aspects. He abides within the expanse of the single sphere, the perfection of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a, as perpetual <strong>great bliss</strong> (<em>dewa chenpo</em>). Thus, the Great Perfection tantra <em>The Revelation of Bodhicitta: Perfect, Pure Reality</em>, refers to him as &quot;self-existing, the dharmatÄ.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time of the path, the mind's obscurations lessen due to the pith-instructions of the guru and the awakening of oneâs own karmic propensities. Then, naked awareness can be <em>introduced</em> directly and <em>decided upon</em>, bringing <em>confidence in</em> the great natural <em>liberation</em>.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> By applying these three key statements, all the qualities of the three kÄyas and the pure visions of path will increase, be perfected and absorbed within all-encompassing space. As they dissolve into great inner luminosity, you capture the citadel of limpid and subtle, great luminous wisdom within the sphere of precious, spontaneous accomplishment.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a></p>
<p>When you gain the realization, experience, and confidence of the dharmatÄ, you conquer the enemy of ignorantly holding to eternalism and nihilism, and destroy the foundation of the three realms of existence. Here, the reference to the enemy of <strong>mÄras</strong> (<em>dÃ¼</em>) means that the mÄras are <strong>tamed</strong> (<em>dul</em>) from within, and thoughts, the basis for dualistic grasping, are defeated by awareness. This vajra of awareness, fierce and ferocious, is the innate yidam <strong>Mighty Wrathful King</strong> (<em>drakpo tsal</em>). You thus attain the supreme level of a fully awakened heruka, a teacher youthful, brave, and powerful. This sacred fruition is referred to in the tantra, <em>The Perfect Profundity of Primal Wisdom</em> as &quot;primordially present.&quot;</p>
<p>The first three lines of this prayer can also be explained respectively according to the mind section (<em>sem dÃ©</em>), the space section (<em>long dÃ©</em>) and the pith-instruction section (<em>mengak dÃ©</em>).<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> Explained generally and according to their literal meaning, the remaining three lines of the prayer can refer to realizations upon the paths of the latter two,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> an invocation of the Guru's <strong>blessings</strong> (<em>jin gyi lab</em>) [to attain these], and a request for these <strong>siddhis</strong> (<em>ngÃ¶drub</em>). So concludes the main explanation of the prayer, according to the general, hidden, and ultimate meanings.</p>
<p>Now, what follows is an explanation according to the sacred syllables:<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> The prayer's first line represents the syllable '<em>e</em>', the element of space, which appears triangular in shape and symbolizes the space of the vajra-queen. This is the mother who gives birth to all the victors, in other words, the <strong>Guru</strong> (<em>guru</em>). The second line represents the syllable '<em>vaá¹</em>', the element of water, which is in the shape of a vajra. It appears as the father or means which gives birth to <strong>great bliss</strong> (<em>dewa chenpo</em>). The third line represents the syllable '<em>ma</em>', the fire element, the <strong>tamer of</strong> the hordes of <strong>demons</strong> (<em>dÃ¼ dul</em>)âthe male or female mÄras, yÄmas, mamos, rÄká¹£asas, bhÅ«tas, and asuras. The great wrathful heruka <strong>Mighty Wrathful King</strong> (<em>dorjÃ© drakpo tsal</em>) is prior to the syllable '<em>ma</em>', and he tramples upon the hosts of arrogant spirits in extreme fury. The fourth line onwards represents the syllable '<em>yÄ</em>', the increase of the wind element, which gives rise to and gathers the qualities of the paths and bhÅ«mis. Thus, this shows how one attains the sacred level of masteryâa king of the dharma, for whom the twofold benefit is spontaneously accomplished.</p>
<p>If you thus recite this prayer one-pointedly, blessings will soon suffuse your whole being, for the compassion of Master PadmÄkara is swift. As he has proclaimed:<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing me, all the buddhas are seen,<br/>
Accomplishing my practice, the practice of all the buddhas is accomplished,<br/>
For I am the embodiment of all the sugatas. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall come, unable to resist,<br/>
When with devotion and strong, fervent prayers<br/>
You pray to me, the Lotus-Born of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.<br/>
I will come to you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, the colophon to the third chapter of <em>The Prayer in Seven Chapters</em>, called <em>The Prayer Requested by Khandro YeshÃ© Tsogyal</em>,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> explains how such prayer will fulfil the needs and wishes of all beings.</p>
<p><em>I, Pema Yeshe Dorje,<br/>
Wrote this short explanation<br/>
As soon as it came to my mind<br/>
On the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month of the Water Bird year.</em><a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> </p>

<p>The quotation in full can be found at the beginning of KyabjÃ© DÃ¼djom Rinpoche's <em><a href="/tibetan-masters/dudjom-rinpoche/concise-benefits-of-festival-of-the-tenth-day">The Concise Benefits of the Festival of the Tenth Day</a></em>. According to DÃ¼djom Rinpoche this quotation stems from the root tantra of <em>The Guru as the Embodiment of Realization</em> (<em>Lama GongdÃ¼</em>), entitled <em>The Pile of Lotus Stems.</em> The same quotation is also found in Mipham RinpochÃ©'s <em>White Lotus</em> (see: Mipham Rinpoche 2015, p. 28). <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Here a parallel is drawn between the outer course of the sun and the moon, and the inner course of the winds within the body. The translation of the initial passage of this section follows Padmakara's translation of a very similar explanation by Mipham Rinpoche. See: Mipham Rinpoche 2015, p. 59. For a further discussion of the circulation of the winds, see: The explanation of the Secret Empowerment in JamgÃ¶n Kongtrul 2017. See also JamgÃ¶n Kongtrul 2005, p. 179 and notes. <a href="#fnref:4" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Jokyab Rinpoche (JamgÃ¶n Kongtrul 2017, endnote 52) describes the <em>haá¹</em> syllable, which means supreme bliss, as having a fourfold nature: 1) white like the autumn moon; 2) bright like a lamp burning sesame oil; 3) round like a bird's egg; and 4) on the verge of melting like mercury. JamgÃ¶n Kongtrul mentions that, rather than the syllable, one can also simply visualize a bindu with similar characteristics. <a href="#fnref:5" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>What follows is an explanation of the famous line &quot;<em>evaá¹ mayÄ ÅrÅ«tam</em>&quot; (&quot;Thus have I heard&quot;) which is found as an introduction to most sÅ«tras and tantras. According to the tantric teachings, each of the syllables (<em>e-vaá¹ ma-yÄ</em>) has a deeper layer of meaning, which is shown here. <a href="#fnref:10" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Jamyang Khyentse cites only the opening words of this and the following quotation; for the sake of clarity both are given here in full. Both quotations appear to be from <em>The Secret Guide to Accomplishing the Guru</em> (<em>bla ma sgrub pa'i gsang them gnad yig</em>) (see also: Mipham Rinpoche 2015, p. 37-38). <a href="#fnref:11" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The colophon to <em><a href="/tibetan-masters/tulku-zangpo-drakpa/leu-dunma-chapter-3">The Prayer Requested by Khandro YesheÌ Tsogyal</a></em> reads: &quot;Pray like this; pray with devotion! For me, PadmÄkara, there is nothing apart from benefiting beings. Through the force of the samaya link, I shall return to the land of Tibet. To those who have faith, I shall actually grant prophecies directly. As regards this prayer, first of all when you recount its story, you will be filled with inspiration. When you see its precious qualities, deep faith will be born within you. When that faith becomes unshakeable trust and devotion, then my blessing will enter and transform you. When your mind is free of all doubts, whatever you wish can be achieved.&quot; <a href="#fnref:12" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
